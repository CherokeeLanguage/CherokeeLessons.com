1
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:08,460
today we're going to demonstrate how to

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:13,160
take a public domain comic book

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:17,160
take a story out of it clean it up

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,900
and prayer parrot for re-lettering with

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,279
Cherokee

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:26,460
this purpose of this is to use

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,380
already existing material to reduce the

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,099
amount of Labor

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,059
and how long it takes to produce new

10
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:39,239
educational material for use by students

11
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:43,920
Comics are a real good medium

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:46,379
for teaching languages because a lot of

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,920
the story is done graphically and does

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:53,640
not require descriptions in language

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,039
the only thing that's really

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,719
um

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,640
translatable or it needs to be

18
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,680
translated and put into the target

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,960
language is the dialogue which is

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,479
actually a more important component of

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,580
language and learning okay the first

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,020
single thing we need to do is to

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,119
actually get a

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,280
comic book and download it so that we

25
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,720
can get the images for the pages out of

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,760
it

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,320
um in this particular case we are going

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,340
to be using

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,460
um

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,159
a portion of the comic book series Billy

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,979
and buggy bear

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,700
um a

33
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:36,360
a group of students and teacher have

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,119
been translating it into Cherokee so

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,880
it's a good starting point

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,740
to

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,740
demonstrate how to take what they've

38
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,180
done as far as translation work goes and

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,180
to

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,619
repurpose a comment with re-lettering in

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,240
Cherokee

42
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,720
so the first thing we've got to do is

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,040
we've got to go do a site such as

44
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,960
comicbookplus.com there are other sites

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,840
available but this one is one of the

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,500
easier ones that we have found to use

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,799
so I want to search for Billy and muggie

48
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,799
Bear

49
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,360
and here it is and it'll actually show

50
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,599
multiple

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,300
um like setups for it so we'll just

52
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,000
click on the first one here okay

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,220
the particular one that they are

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,980
translating from is Billy and buggy

55
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,379
Bearer issue number 10.

56
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,900
so we'll go to that so now we have issue

57
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,620
number 10 being displayed so what we

58
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,840
need to do now is to download the file

59
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,220
so I want to place it into a folder I've

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,080
already created myself a folder called

61
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,480
comics and inside that I've been created

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,220
another folder called Billy and Boogie

63
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:53,940
Bear the file will end with cbz this

64
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:58,620
means compressed comic book zip

65
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:01,200
so we'll go ahead and save it there

66
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,459
as soon as it's saved

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,220
we can close out the web browser

68
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,920
and we come over here

69
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,620
and so here is the file so now I can

70
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,879
right click the file on here and tell it

71
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,879
I wish to extract it

72
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,060
Windows machines and MAC machines

73
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,340
probably do that a little bit

74
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,959
differently but it should be very

75
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,220
similar to what I'm doing here with my

76
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,800
Linux box

77
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,060
so now I can go into this folder

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:36,180
now so as you can see each page

79
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,159
is an image so like for page one

80
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,260
or image one is the cover page

81
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,879
so image two this is an ad that was in

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,860
the comic

83
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,860
um from based on this they've skipped

84
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,780
the inside of the cover because it's

85
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,940
probably blank

86
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,400
and like here we have the first story in

87
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,920
this particular comment Pat and Mike in

88
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,860
this clear case we're looking for

89
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,780
um specifically salty turtle

90
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,860
in this

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,860
here

92
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,860
so let's take a look at the actual page

93
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,920
so what you're looking at is the first

94
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,680
to keep in mind is that Comics

95
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,320
especially in the 40s and 50s

96
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,380
and probably all the way up through the

97
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,380
90s and even modern Comics to some

98
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:29,180
degree were printed on a thin cream

99
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:32,220
paper so this is why this isn't white

100
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,680
aging of the paper additionally has

101
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,419
occurred which makes it even darker

102
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,639
so that's one of the things we have to

103
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,139
correct for

104
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,680
um in this particular case we'll be

105
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,840
removing all of this paper color right

106
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,360
here because we don't want it we want it

107
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,400
to be transparent so that it doesn't

108
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,800
impact anything we're doing

109
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,699
and it's the same thing for here

110
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,699
and here

111
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,680
for the speech bubbles and

112
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,360
things like we know for a factor must be

113
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,240
white we normally just remove that and

114
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,000
put a white true white in so that it

115
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,639
um displays better in modern printing

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,520
for paper Printing and displays better

117
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,860
in ebook readers

118
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,900
one other thing that normally has to be

119
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,820
handled

120
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,840
depending upon your needs is the removal

121
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,460
of English writing from various portions

122
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,440
of the text

123
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,139
this particular case there's English

124
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,720
writing

125
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:36,600
in the image on the book that's one

126
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,720
thing that has to be corrected

127
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,720
um

128
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,080
is usually a few but not many this way

129
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,759
for example this wanted poster also has

130
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,259
English writing on it that will need to

131
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,080
be removed

132
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,240
and I'll show you how one way of doing

133
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,699
that there's not a

134
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,520
set way but there is a way and I can

135
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:05,160
show you how I go about doing it so I

136
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,160
have a program called [ __ ] installed and

137
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,259
I use it

138
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,080
for

139
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,919
um Graphics manipulation so this is the

140
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,919
main program here

141
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,100
and I will go ahead and open up

142
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,660
number 29 which is the first image of

143
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,979
the story we're wanting to do here I can

144
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,360
have a preview so now I'm looking at the

145
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,000
right one

146
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,080
and I can hit open

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,139
now [ __ ] normally saves things in a

148
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,300
format called xcf so that's the first

149
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,960
thing we need to do is to save this as

150
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,940
xcf so I just hit file save as it's

151
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,139
already going to put the xcf on the end

152
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,660
and the rest of the name is going to be

153
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,340
the same so I can do that it's going to

154
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,979
be in the same location that I'm pulling

155
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,660
from which is fine for now and I can hit

156
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,560
save

157
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:01,560
so now I have a way to save my changes

158
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:04,919
as a work in progress okay the first

159
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,039
thing we need to do is to apply what's

160
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,139
called level adjustments

161
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:13,020
um

162
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,979
it's kind of the black really isn't

163
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,020
black

164
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,539
and we would like to get a better

165
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,220
contrast in the intensity of the colors

166
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:24,660
before we start

167
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:27,060
so we go to so we go to colors

168
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,580
levels

169
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,380
so what we're going to look at is the

170
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,099
input levels we're going to leave the

171
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,900
output levels to 0 and 255.

172
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:39,360
what we're going to need to do is if you

173
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,860
look at this waveform right here this

174
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,919
represents where

175
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,479
the visual range of the images so if I

176
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,280
can sit here and I can grab this one and

177
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,960
I can move it over

178
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,759
like that

179
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,560
and if you notice the black actually

180
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,780
turns black

181
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,639
and gives in all the colors actually

182
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,560
become enhanced

183
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,599
then we can move this one down just a

184
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,400
little bit

185
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,400
to get rid of the washout some

186
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,199
and we can probably move this up a

187
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,199
little bit more

188
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,099
say about there so make a note of these

189
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,699
numbers because we want to apply the

190
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:27,960
exact same settings

191
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:31,440
to any future pages from the same scan

192
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,140
of the same comic book each comic book

193
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,459
that you do will have to be this will

194
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,740
have to be recalculated each time as

195
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:39,599
each version of the comic book was going

196
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,580
to be slightly different due to aging

197
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,279
Etc so in this particular case I

198
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,880
selected 45 and here right here you can

199
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,740
see where you can actually

200
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,140
pick a collar that you want to be

201
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,080
treated as black and here you can pick a

202
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,399
colors you want to treat as white so

203
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,260
let's go ahead and do that so you can

204
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,040
see how that works we'll click this one

205
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,279
here

206
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,420
well first we'll um zoom in so we can

207
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,540
see better

208
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,080
what we're doing and then we're going to

209
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,120
um

210
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,440
tell I want

211
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,440
this to be my black

212
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:19,200
and then I want to tell it I want

213
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,640
this to be my white

214
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,740
Zoom back out

215
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,740
and I can see what and see how it looks

216
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,459
so that actually does improve it a

217
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,860
little bit better now you can see where

218
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:37,140
the paper was original color the paper

219
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,360
most likely was probably like this and

220
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,899
here you can see the Aging of the paper

221
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,000
whereas the darker areas

222
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,839
so let's go ahead and use these values

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,360
then

224
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,080
um which would be

225
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,040
58

226
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,040
and 217.

227
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,620
okay now that that's done

228
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:04,100
the next thing we need to do is begin

229
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,600
removing

230
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,000
portions that need to become transparent

231
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,220
okay the next step we need to do is we

232
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,660
need to add a transparency layer the

233
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,000
reason we need to add a transparency

234
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,300
layer is because to remove this stuff

235
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,339
and have it become transparent so that

236
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,399
it's not anything not even you know

237
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:26,540
neither white nor black nor anything

238
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,600
it allows anything below it to show up

239
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:33,060
we have to add a special layer for that

240
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,820
jpegs by default do not

241
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,820
work with transparency options you have

242
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,920
to add it okay for the transparency uh

243
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,640
that's a two-step process first we need

244
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,279
to select this which is the image

245
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:50,160
this is a layer of You by the way so we

246
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,200
hit layer and the first thing we're

247
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,500
going to do is add what's called an

248
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,380
alpha Channel this allows this

249
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,899
particular component to be see-through

250
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,880
to the layer below it so we're going to

251
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,220
first hit add Alpha Channel

252
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,140
then we're going to hit the add layer

253
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,000
button we don't need to worry about

254
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,600
naming it we just need to make sure the

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,459
fill width says transparency

256
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,440
and then hit OK then we need to change

257
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,500
the order so this layer needs to get

258
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,200
moved down below this layer

259
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,740
so once we've done this as a

260
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,740
demonstration

261
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,959
you can now make it transparent method

262
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,519
of removing things from this image it's

263
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,500
important to have the layer you're

264
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,540
working with selected in this case in

265
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,860
every case it's going to be the jpeg

266
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,459
layer

267
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,560
so now I can select the um

268
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:46,920
fuzzy select tool

269
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:52,320
which will allow me to select areas for

270
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:55,459
removal based upon similar colors

271
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,160
um and I can increase the amount of area

272
00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:01,440
being selected for removable by

273
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,839
pulling the mouse down and I can reduce

274
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,540
the amount of area selected for removal

275
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,720
by moving the mouse up this is while I

276
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,160
have the left Mouse button clicked so

277
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,040
when I do this what I'm going to be

278
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,260
doing is I'm going to click and hold

279
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,399
and then I'm going to pull down

280
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,399
and I'm going to watch

281
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:25,079
for any areas that get removed I don't

282
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,519
want remove as soon as I see that which

283
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,200
is like right here I'm seeing areas that

284
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,060
I want removed

285
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,800
I need to go back up

286
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,800
to where they're put back

287
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,820
something like that then I need to hit

288
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:46,019
delete button and now you can see where

289
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:49,260
the paper uh will go the cream paper has

290
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:51,420
been removed from the image now I need

291
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,220
to zoom in

292
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,420
because here we have some more areas

293
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,779
that need to be removed so I'm going to

294
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,579
click and hold I'm going to pull down

295
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:02,600
then I'm going to hit delete button and

296
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,600
I will repeat here

297
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,519
and I can repeat here

298
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,639
zoom out make sure I didn't mess

299
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,639
anything up

300
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:19,560
it all looks good

301
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,240
now if you look you'll you'll see little

302
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,800
spots like that

303
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,480
and one of the things that can be done

304
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,700
is I can click right here

305
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,980
and then I can start pulling down

306
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,980
and it will get more spots that way

307
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,399
that is not what I wanted

308
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,060
there's whenever that becomes a problem

309
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,860
I'm hitting Ctrl shift a to deselect

310
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,600
everything whenever that becomes a

311
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,180
problem where when you're trying to

312
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,519
remove it and it just won't let you

313
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,980
um most of the work's already done with

314
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,220
what I was wanting removed so what I'm

315
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:07,980
going to do now is I'm going to take

316
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,100
the rectangle selection tool

317
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,740
and I'm going to select

318
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,760
up to next to the image there

319
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,760
I want to hit delete

320
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,839
and I'm going to go

321
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,700
do the same thing on this side I'm going

322
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,260
to get as close as I can

323
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,260
without actually touching anything

324
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,519
and I'm going to hit the delete button

325
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,519
onto the bottom

326
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,560
and I'm going to repeat

327
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,740
I don't want to do it for this section

328
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,740
here like this

329
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,720
and this doesn't have to be perfect by

330
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,980
the way it has got to be good enough to

331
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,320
help with

332
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,160
the next steps which is just getting it

333
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,160
mostly cleaned up

334
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,540
all right so the next thing I need to do

335
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,040
is now we have all this extra space at

336
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,620
the bottom

337
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
now that we really don't need

338
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,160
um

339
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,620
but we'll take care of this

340
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,040
um later we need to kind of keep the

341
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,199
page size consistent

342
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,579
and we can we'll look at how to do that

343
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,579
later

344
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:44,120
all right so I'm going to save my work

345
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,120
so far

346
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,959
It's always important to do that

347
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,100
then we're going to go to the speech

348
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,079
bubbles

349
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,680
so I'm going to go back to my fuzzy

350
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,680
select tool

351
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:00,480
and then I'm going to be like that you

352
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,820
can see now that most of the speech

353
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,680
bubble has been cleared out then I can

354
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,720
go to here to this one which is called

355
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,639
the free select tool and I can actually

356
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,660
draw

357
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,660
like this

358
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:15,019
very carefully

359
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,399
not to go back to where it started from

360
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,180
it'll dot will light up then I can let

361
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,880
go

362
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,399
I'm going to press delete

363
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,899
and then I can press Ctrl shift a to

364
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,000
make the selection go away to see if

365
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,980
there's any spots left there is

366
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,260
do like that

367
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,440
remove that final spot

368
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,180
so now I have a clear speech bubble

369
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,100
which I can then

370
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,100
use to re-letter later

371
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,800
we'll repeat

372
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,699
um

373
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,699
same thing here

374
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,199
zoom in so I can see what we're doing

375
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,199
better

376
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:15,020
control day

377
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,620
oops

378
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,620
Fuzzy's leg

379
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,780
free select

380
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,640
so the speech bubble has been totally

381
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,340
cleared out next up is actually optional

382
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,440
I have a tendency to want to remove any

383
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,900
English from the

384
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,080
um Comics I'm re-lettering which

385
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:12,059
includes things like the title

386
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,980
and again seeing English where it's

387
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:17,100
feasible sometimes it's just really not

388
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:20,160
very feasible and then later we can put

389
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,640
in a different font in Cherokee for the

390
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,440
title and the same thing for here

391
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,240
we'll be using inkscape to do the second

392
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,500
part the first part here which we're

393
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:34,559
using with just [ __ ] is strictly

394
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,900
for cleaning up the images

395
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,340
so as you can see we're going to have

396
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,520
two sections that are going to need

397
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,320
adjustment

398
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,880
and there's two ways to go about doing

399
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,640
this I can either do it totally in

400
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,940
inkscape or I can do it

401
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:54,059
or I can remove the text using in what

402
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,919
they call endpaint functions and like

403
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,020
the same thing for here

404
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,120
so that I have a clean template to work

405
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,740
with in inkscape and that's what we're

406
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,299
going to do on this one because and it's

407
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,520
mainly because of the

408
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:08,160
um the amount of texture to be easier

409
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,679
when we put it in inkscape to re-letter

410
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,740
when we uh if we don't have all this up

411
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,240
here that we have to hide using inkscape

412
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,039
if this actually does not end the image

413
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,020
at all so what we're going to do is

414
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,419
we're going to go to here

415
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,419
and we're going to go to clone

416
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,740
smudge clone tool so what we're going to

417
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,100
do is we select what we want to clone

418
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,100
from

419
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:40,100
okay you have to control click

420
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,100
and you can see over there on the right

421
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,179
that

422
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,440
the button where I control clicked is

423
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:52,260
right there and where I'm painting over

424
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,120
everything is literally just duplicating

425
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,460
from over there and the reason I want to

426
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,000
do that because it maintains the um

427
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,280
coloration the same and the dots of the

428
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,280
way the ink hit the paper is largely the

429
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,700
same enough to where you can't it

430
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,980
becomes less obvious this was done

431
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,860
um this is actually a photo shoot

432
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,059
Photoshop technique by the way

433
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,600
even though I've never really used

434
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:17,600
Photoshop

435
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,360
so I'll get this cleared up here

436
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,320
so now I actually can set my thing over

437
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,660
here now it'll have more black area to

438
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,660
work from and I can now do this

439
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,299
I need someone let go this is going to

440
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,340
go back to beginning so I can do it like

441
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:54,419
a little bit and then it gets too close

442
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:59,660
to the letter A I can let go

443
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:59,660
repeat P repeat repeat

444
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,340
and as you can see this actually works

445
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,679
out pretty well

446
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,200
um I have to do something similar but

447
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,760
different

448
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,140
selections over for the next set of

449
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,140
words our next word

450
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,419
and if you're on Windows and Mac [ __ ] is

451
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,200
available to download and install you

452
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,200
have to um

453
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,980
look it up

454
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,159
White

455
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,039
now if I were to look at this really

456
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,720
close which I'll do just a second so you

457
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,940
can see

458
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,539
um it's not a perfect

459
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,820
um

460
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:04,860
it's usually flaws of some sort or

461
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,900
another in it but that's fine

462
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,000
see there's actually little spots of red

463
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,760
stuff let's find this totally harmless

464
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,880
because of my goal is just to get rid of

465
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,679
the English text while still maintaining

466
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,659
a general appearance of what the

467
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,179
original Comet looks like

468
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:23,580
now this one is a little bit differently

469
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,260
what I'll have to do over here is I'll

470
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,820
have to select

471
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:31,280
background

472
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,280
and then I'll have to do like this

473
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,760
very carefully

474
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,200
here you can see where it's actually

475
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,059
disappearing where it actually makes it

476
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,440
takes totally disappear

477
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,440
as if it never was there

478
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,520
yeah and I do have to periodically let

479
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,559
go of the mouse then press it back down

480
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,840
again

481
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:01,100
so that it keeps going back to the area

482
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,100
I'm trying to clone from

483
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,280
now this over here will probably work

484
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,200
out better

485
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,039
if I were to clone

486
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,120
um

487
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:14,100
the line itself so I'll line up here and

488
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,860
I'll control click to set the new clone

489
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,640
from point and then what I can do is

490
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:24,600
then I can just go up following the line

491
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,980
and keep letting go periodically

492
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,980
we need to do this lower

493
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,620
as you can see it's actually

494
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,620
allow me to do a line

495
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,500
I got to keep letting go periodically

496
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,980
and if I zoom in I can now get rid of

497
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,440
the stuff over here

498
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:04,080
get the um

499
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,240
free select tool we'll zoom in pretty

500
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,240
good so that we can draw better

501
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:16,679
all right so now we do not have any

502
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,080
English text the only thing I'm

503
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,419
interested in doing is I can see these

504
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,220
coloration variation which I a little

505
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:27,140
two more than I would like

506
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,140
so I'll go back to cloning

507
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,500
your adjustments there try to get it to

508
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,500
blend a little bit better

509
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:44,940
yes that'll work better all right

510
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:48,679
so now we gotta work on the book so file

511
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,679
save just in case things crash

512
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:54,440
so we need to do the same thing here so

513
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,720
I'll go ahead and

514
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,780
select let's see here

515
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:04,140
let's do here select as my source

516
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,460
and I can do a little bit at a time

517
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,200
because I don't have that much out of

518
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,240
the area I'm cloning from is not that

519
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,840
large I have to keep doing this a little

520
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,840
bit at a time

521
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,720
release in the mouse and clicking it

522
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,820
back

523
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,140
and here you can see it really doesn't

524
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,120
you really can't tell there was

525
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,039
something really there unless you really

526
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,360
look for any kind of minor distortions

527
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,360
in the background

528
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,340
in fact I don't need this black box at

529
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,340
all let's get rid of the whole Black Box

530
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:54,360
putting in a black box we can always add

531
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,080
it back we really don't have to have a

532
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,080
black box there

533
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,440
main thing we want to do is get a book

534
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,700
with a cover that we can then re-letter

535
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,700
using inkscape

536
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,860
so now we have a empty area for

537
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,020
um

538
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,520
putting new letter in this is kind of

539
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,640
lighter here on it I really don't want

540
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,240
to be more the same or you

541
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,240
a little bit

542
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,340
use a little bit more uniform feel

543
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,779
all right so this is the first page of

544
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,700
the comic

545
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:51,020
um

546
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,020
so I'm going to save it again

547
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:00,360
and then I'm going to go ahead and do

548
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:03,740
the remaining pages in a and you can see

549
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,740
it happen in fast mode

550
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,080
haha

551
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:32,100
okay now that we have the pages cleaned

552
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:35,640
up we need to crop them all

553
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,380
um based upon the visual information on

554
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,720
each page

555
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,020
so I'll go ahead and open them up one at

556
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,020
a time

557
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:49,559
and we'll pause away again works I go

558
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,919
ahead and open the rest of them up one

559
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,919
by one

560
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,120
so pretty much what we want is we're

561
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,679
wanting to get rid of all this Blank

562
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,880
Space

563
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,919
um so we're going to go to image

564
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,640
crop to content

565
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:14,100
you can see here it now has removed all

566
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,200
the extraneous blank space from around

567
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:21,200
the common

568
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,200
so I can save that close it and repeat

569
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,880
now here you will see like right here it

570
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,320
couldn't crop all the way it takes to

571
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,820
the Box because the gun is sticking

572
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,440
outside the box that's

573
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,440
happens a lot with comics

574
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,899
okay the next thing I'm going to do is

575
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,720
I'm going to create

576
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:03,679
um move all the xcf files

577
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,679
out of here

578
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,220
and I'm going to put them into a new

579
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,220
folder

580
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,840
call The Salty turtle

581
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,179
and because this is from issue 10 we're

582
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,919
going to put a 10 at the end

583
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,960
and then we're going to paste them into

584
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:29,340
here

585
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:32,640
okay so now these are the original hcfs

586
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,799
they still contain the transparency as

587
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,779
layers and other things needed for a

588
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,940
bitmap manipulation we need to convert

589
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:41,460
these into a format that we can load

590
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:44,960
into the inkscape program so I'm going

591
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,960
to open them back up again

592
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,299
um all of them

593
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:02,399
and I need to do a file

594
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:05,940
export as which is Ctrl shift e

595
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,919
and then I'm warning PNG right here so

596
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,200
it's got I gotta change it to dot PNG

597
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,860
and you make sure it's in my working

598
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,860
folder

599
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,039
and I'm going to hit export

600
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,039
and explore again

601
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,340
I do this for each of the images

602
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:06,419
all right so now we have

603
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:08,940
pngs for each of these images now

604
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:12,240
um keep things simpler one I'm going to

605
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:16,519
go ahead and create subfolders

606
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,519
this is going to be the um

607
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,880
uh Raw

608
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,840
images

609
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,640
we're gonna move everything into there

610
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:32,039
and I'll show you why in just a second

611
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,360
this way we're not confused so we got

612
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:35,360
all the raw images are in here

613
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,120
all right so here's I have the xcf

614
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,760
images I started off with that I cleaned

615
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,539
up this is the PNG versions which I need

616
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:03,240
the PNG versions for the generating the

617
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,740
actual uh for look for importing into

618
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,840
inkscape

619
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,879
and

620
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,040
um so I'm calling this raw images

621
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,480
because this is before I do any

622
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,480
lettering

623
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,659
so now

624
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,540
I need to activate inkscape inkscape is

625
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,480
also available for Windows and Mac

626
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:27,859
okay now the first thing I need to do is

627
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,859
change the paper size

628
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,580
um it's defaults to us letter for me I

629
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,220
mean it might be different for you so

630
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,500
you need to double check

631
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:40,740
as a general rule of thumb Comics are

632
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,899
not eight and a half by eleven even

633
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,280
though I put them away and have both of

634
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,740
them part of the time but if they're

635
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,000
Standalone I generally try to stick with

636
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,000
like six by nine

637
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,899
because it gets I mean it's not really

638
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,460
the correct aspiration for a true

639
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:58,800
comment which I think is like seven by

640
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,339
ten or something like that

641
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,440
um but this is close enough and and if

642
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:06,720
you're planning on doing print on demand

643
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,880
this is an available paper size you can

644
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,040
use for print on demand

645
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,619
so we're going to change the units back

646
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,740
to pixels

647
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:18,440
and then we can close this and so now we

648
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,560
have the 6x9

649
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,560
sheet and

650
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,940
internal this is going to be

651
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,940
um

652
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,240
page

653
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,240
189 I believe

654
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,680
okay so we got page 29. now I can go to

655
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,680
here

656
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,680
and

657
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:03,320
port and image doc

658
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,320
ument comics

659
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,940
I don't want the raw images and I want

660
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,460
to go ahead and get the first raw image

661
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:17,040
and so here it is and I'm going to hit

662
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,400
Ctrl shift a and we're going to center

663
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,400
it

664
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,780
actually does not fit the page so I need

665
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,640
to adjust this and I need them and I'll

666
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,480
need to record these numbers that I

667
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,339
adjust

668
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,440
so first thing we want to do is go and

669
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:39,960
change this to zero for the x coordinate

670
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,579
changes to zero for the y coordinate so

671
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,740
that it lines up with the top left

672
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,460
corner of the paper

673
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,540
[Music]

674
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:50,579
um

675
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:53,160
and then we need to add a margin

676
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:55,680
for the printing process

677
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:59,400
um 0.5 inches is usually pretty safe to

678
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,960
add so I'm adding 0.5 and 0.5 this way

679
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,640
and this way you can see how it moves

680
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,420
down

681
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,740
um

682
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:10,260
so this right here because it's uh six

683
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,160
what first I need to lock this

684
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:17,400
keep these two numbers mathematically

685
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:19,940
corrected with each other so six minus

686
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,940
one inch

687
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,640
so this would give a half an inch here

688
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,320
and a half an inch here and I can tell

689
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,780
it to recenter again so it's on the

690
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,240
centered on the paper so as you can see

691
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:36,240
it comic books

692
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,460
um don't exactly fit 6x9 but this is a

693
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,660
pretty uh close and this actually gives

694
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,240
you an option if you wanted to do extra

695
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,700
things at the top of the bottom you can

696
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,700
Okay so

697
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,700
now what we need to do is get the

698
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,800
document

699
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,980
contains the

700
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,980
um

701
00:37:56,339 --> 00:38:01,980
um Cherokee language

702
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:04,520
translations

703
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:07,079
Okay so

704
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,079
amaha nadoxi

705
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,900
now doxy is really Terrapin and is not a

706
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:17,460
generic term for turtle

707
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:20,400
um just as an FYI so this is the title

708
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,440
which goes there so what I need to do

709
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,400
then is I need to go here I need to tell

710
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,400
I want to do text

711
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,960
then I need to tell it I want

712
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:34,280
um

713
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,280
Cherokee hand one

714
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,460
and I'm going to set this as my default

715
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,320
font

716
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,700
and they won't close that then we'll go

717
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,040
over here where it says the letter A

718
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,420
which is creating edit text boxes or

719
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,400
text objects

720
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,359
and I want to click here and I'm going

721
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,420
to write

722
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,420
um

723
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,440
in Cherokee

724
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,839
my writing

725
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,520
foreign

726
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:22,680
okay so this is going to be a fancy

727
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:25,940
graphic right here so I need to actually

728
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,940
use a different font

729
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,440
so okay so I'm looking at the different

730
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,300
font options we have available on the

731
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,700
cherokeelescence.com website so I can

732
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,740
see them all real quickly

733
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:41,700
and

734
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:44,099
let me see the Donnie said

735
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,280
might be decent let's take a look at

736
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:46,280
that

737
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,460
let's go down take a look

738
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,480
so what I want to do a fuse I want to

739
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,480
make sure you're

740
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,500
fill is white for the moment

741
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,400
cheer outline

742
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:19,820
in the stroked is black okay

743
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,820
so we'll move this over here

744
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:32,359
so the original one had text here and

745
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,359
text here

746
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,839
um

747
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,920
but we're not going to do it that way

748
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:43,020
we're going to do a like this

749
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,000
so we're going to click it again so I

750
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,280
get a little turning arrows I want to

751
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,720
rotate it

752
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,320
and then we'll click again and get the

753
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,320
stretchers

754
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,660
so I won't duplicate it

755
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,099
all that

756
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:28,800
Okay so

757
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,980
the original comic book

758
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,980
foreign

759
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,160
red and yellow

760
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,160
that seems decent

761
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,820
so we'll take this one

762
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,520
a little set to feel red

763
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:53,900
I'll take this one

764
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,900
let's set the fill to Yellow

765
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,420
now one of the things you have to be

766
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,339
really care about when you're doing

767
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,540
these translations is not to overflow

768
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:17,579
the text box with Cherokee text

769
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:21,900
sometimes this requires adjusting the

770
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:23,960
dialogue to fit the text the balloon

771
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,960
um

772
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:29,940
so again we're in Cherokee him one right

773
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:32,220
now we normally pick a fixed font size

774
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,320
for this

775
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:37,859
um so

776
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:40,619
the stroke I need to be nothing so I

777
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:44,240
want to set the stroke to nothing

778
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,240
set the field to be black

779
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:51,680
I'm gonna go here

780
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,680
I'm going to click right there

781
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,540
and it goes to go

782
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,540
the

783
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,720
D ski

784
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
um

785
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,280
yo

786
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:20,720
I'm not sure about you you old

787
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,700
okay let's do this again I don't want

788
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,060
true I don't want I want to feel

789
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:44,060
okay

790
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:51,380
and you can see this is a lot of texture

791
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,380
I stick in here

792
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,920
so I'm going to change the font

793
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,420
and it's usually best to try to keep the

794
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,619
font size consistent between

795
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:05,000
um

796
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:05,000
for the entire comic

797
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:40,700
all right

798
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,920
foreign

799
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:46,319
okay so there's the first page with the

800
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:48,960
Cherokee lettering added including the

801
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:51,980
book title and pretty much

802
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:56,400
all of the um

803
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:58,619
boxes of speech bubbles filled in now

804
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,440
one thing we do need to do is because

805
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:04,200
this is a transparency and this is a

806
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,480
transparency we need to add a white

807
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,579
background

808
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,920
um so that when we export this as an

809
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:13,440
image it has white

810
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,619
in the correct spots if we don't these

811
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:20,119
will turn transparent in the exported

812
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:23,819
image which is not what we want so

813
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:29,579
we know the size of the paper

814
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:29,579
which is 576 by 864.

815
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:34,980
in pixels

816
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:37,440
so what we want to do is we'll go over

817
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:40,619
here to box create rectangle square

818
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,400
we'll draw a rectangle

819
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,560
um

820
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,359
pretty much if you look at the bottom

821
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,119
you see where it says click to set fill

822
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:49,859
shift click to set stroke we don't want

823
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:52,500
a stroke

824
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:55,560
we want the field to be white

825
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:58,319
and then up here it's going to give you

826
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,819
some various options for the box but

827
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,380
these are not the options we want to

828
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:04,560
change what we need to do is hit the

829
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,660
select and transform option here

830
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,940
and this change as you can see the it

831
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,040
changes like this and then this becomes

832
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,079
the x coordinate and y coordinate on the

833
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,280
paper starting at the top left so zero

834
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:16,260
zeros here

835
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,420
so let's go ahead and move it there we

836
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,859
want to move the zero and zero so it's

837
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:24,180
at the top

838
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:27,480
and then we know the paper is

839
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:29,760
uh well first one okay this right here

840
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,380
um with this turned on if this number

841
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,300
changes this number changes the

842
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,040
proportional faction if you change this

843
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,020
number this number will change the

844
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,720
proportional fashion that's how you

845
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,760
prevent uh incorrect aspect ratio

846
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,500
stretching as you have this turned on if

847
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,720
you turn this off which is what we need

848
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,960
to do right now then it doesn't and then

849
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:53,579
it only uh impacts which one we type

850
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:59,520
into so we know that the paper is 576.

851
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:59,520
exactly and the height is exactly 864.

852
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:04,500
so now we have a a white box which is

853
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:07,440
the exact size of the paper

854
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,300
now I'm going to press the uh end button

855
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,240
while I got it highlighted

856
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:14,400
and that sends it to the background and

857
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,359
lets everything else be on the front

858
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,359
so now

859
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,380
I didn't type that right

860
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:30,260
576 864. yes so that's all right

861
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,260
is that

862
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:40,020
okay anyway that's the correct size so

863
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,920
now we have the complete image now when

864
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,579
you're

865
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,160
um

866
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:48,119
so the inkscape format cannot be

867
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,619
directly used in most programs and for

868
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:52,560
type setting and things you'll need to

869
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:56,819
change the formatting so what we'll need

870
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,980
to do is for ebooks and for print

871
00:48:56,819 --> 00:49:01,440
generally they

872
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:03,839
generally prefer jpeg

873
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,960
but we have to do this as a two-step

874
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:10,619
process because inkscape only exports as

875
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:13,140
PNG so we'll export the PNG

876
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,460
first we want to do the entire page so

877
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,319
we get the page button right here that's

878
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:18,420
very very important you double check

879
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:21,960
that it's actually doing the page

880
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:26,300
then right here we have the DPI

881
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,300
um generally 300 DPI is good

882
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:30,660
um though it takes up more space

883
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,660
um

884
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:36,180
it's up here the exporting it's not down

885
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:38,160
here like I was expecting it

886
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,540
I guess now I can close that and I can

887
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,400
close this

888
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,020
now it's going to ask me to say to SVG

889
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,520
because I exported them go ahead and

890
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:49,099
save that too that way it keeps track of

891
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,099
the volume I used so here's the original

892
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:56,040
and I go to here right here all right so

893
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:58,859
this is the SVG we created this is the

894
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:01,079
inkscape file

895
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:05,060
and this PNG is what we exported out of

896
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:05,060
inkscape and as you can see

897
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:10,160
we now have an image of the comic

898
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,180
about the lettering put in place

899
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,280
now the only catch is because the amount

900
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,540
of text we're trying to fit into the

901
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,240
speech bubbles

902
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:33,359
we're using a slightly smaller than

903
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,579
desired font and it's a little bit light

904
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:37,800
on the type that's the only way to

905
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:40,020
really make it fit for this particular

906
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:43,280
translation

907
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,280
um and dialogue selection

908
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:54,319
so that pretty much covers how to take

909
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:57,480
images from an existing comic

910
00:50:54,319 --> 00:51:01,260
and adjust it and clean it up a little

911
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:04,619
bit and then reloader it using [ __ ] and

912
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:07,980
inkscape when it comes to actually doing

913
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:11,339
the type setting it really depends on

914
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:13,440
what you're trying to accomplish

915
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:16,680
um if you're going through whether it's

916
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,760
ebook or paper you have to have a cover

917
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,940
image

918
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,760
which is appropriate to the content so

919
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,980
it's usually recommended to do most or

920
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,440
all of a complete comic depending upon

921
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:30,540
the how complex the content is that's

922
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,579
why you can use the original artwork and

923
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:34,920
adjust it with Cherokee writing from the

924
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:35,819
original cover

925
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,180
um

926
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:40,740
as far as software goes there are

927
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,800
different options if you're only wanting

928
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:45,720
to say go to Kindle

929
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,520
there's actually a special Kindle editor

930
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,040
which allows you to lay out fixed

931
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,960
formats like comic books you can

932
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,300
actually have it set up if you don't

933
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,740
mind doing all the extra work having it

934
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,520
where you can zoom into the individual

935
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:01,619
boxes and things like that in the Kindle

936
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:05,400
but it takes a bit of extra effort when

937
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:08,280
it comes to print format one program as

938
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:11,280
you can look at using is scribus as

939
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,280
c-r-i-b-u-s

940
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,280
um it's a page layout program designed

941
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:18,960
for laying things out on paper it's

942
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,020
really good it's supposed to be

943
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:26,940
professional grade and it's available at

944
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:28,800
no charge for multiple platforms as well

945
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,680
um another option depending upon your

946
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,859
needs is

947
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:39,059
um LibreOffice which can actually you

948
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:40,800
can actually use to create uh epubs with

949
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:42,900
um though I've never done that for

950
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,720
Comics to see whether it's how good or

951
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,339
bad the results are for like smash words

952
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,760
because smashwords has an automatic

953
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:52,940
conversion process where they'll convert

954
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,960
Microsoft Office docs to

955
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,540
ePub for you anything you can download

956
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,760
it and take a look at it

957
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:02,240
it also can handle the Libre office

958
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,660
which is a free product as well

959
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:08,700
there are various options including

960
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:10,500
typesetting languages like latex which

961
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,020
is what I generally use in combination

962
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,300
with a program called licks but that's

963
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:18,720
generally

964
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:22,920
for the more computer savvy individual

965
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:25,440
whereas a program like scribus

966
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:28,460
um and LibreOffice and things like that

967
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:32,040
are more oriented to

968
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:34,040
uh less technically Savvy when it comes

969
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,720
to actually needing to

970
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:38,520
do specific types of layout that are

971
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,980
actually needed in latex which is what I

972
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,380
use for

973
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:46,559
my general books it has lots of text in

974
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:48,240
them because I find the results better

975
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,819
than trying to do it manually because it

976
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,680
has a lot of automatic stuff you can use

977
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:54,200
but it's not really appropriate for

978
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:58,200
Comics per se

979
00:53:54,200 --> 00:54:01,339
well I hope this helps and uh

980
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,339
don't let that go huh
