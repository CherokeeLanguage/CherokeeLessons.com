Here I demonstrate how to take a public domain comic book, take a
story from it, clean it up, and prepare it for re-lettering with
Cherokee Syllabary using [[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)] and [[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)].

The reason we want to do this instead of producing new content
from scratch is to reduce the amount of labour from many months
to only a day for the re-lettering process, once translation has
been performed.

Comics are a good medium for teaching languages because a lot
of the story is presented graphically and allows teaching
dialogue with good context. Besides, many comics are fun to read.

This also allows focus to be more on dialogue type learning and
reduces the amount of vocabulary, especially for new learners,
needed to begin using the language in a productive way.
