[Cherokee-English Dictionary Online](http://www.cherokeedictionary.net/)

 This is an online dictionary of Cherokee where you can search by English word or Cherokee using either Syllabary or "phonetics." It includes vocabulary from several important sources.

 Hosts various additional resources such as [online transliterating](http://www.cherokeedictionary.net/transliteration), a [grammar guide](http://www.cherokeedictionary.net/grammar), and various available [Cherokee/English dual language texts](http://www.cherokeedictionary.net/corpus/corpusMain).
 
 Created by volunteer effort as a labor of love for the Cherokee language and the desire to make resources as readily available as possible.
