This web site is for Cherokee language learners at the intermediate beginner level and above. It is recommended to have (mostly) learned the Cherokee Syllabary, some words, and a few basics of Cherokee grammar. There are simple dialogues and also more advanced stories on this site with vocabulary. In addition, you will find some basic explanations of Cherokee grammar and Verb Pages with many verbs conjugated with all five stems. (Working on getting all of them fleshed out!). Audio files and podcasts are available to help with the sounds of Cherokee.
<!-- more -->
The Cherokee represented on this site is mostly the Eastern version spoken on the Qualla Boundary in North Carolina but some stories are in the Oklahoma Western version.
