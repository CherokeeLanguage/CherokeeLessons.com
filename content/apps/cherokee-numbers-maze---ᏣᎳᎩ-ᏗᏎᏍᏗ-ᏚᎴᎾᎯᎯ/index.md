### About

This is a simple platformer game to assist with learning the Cherokee numbers.

You wander around in a maze and collect dice together that match the challenge given, then explode them.

After you have completed all the challenges for a level you move on to the next larger level with more numbers to learn.

### Play Online

<!-- more -->

If you would like to play online with your computer, visit [HTML-Games/NumbersMaze](/HTML-Games/NumberMaze/index.html). **No guarentees it will work**.

#### You may have to click **in** the game window to have Audio!

I *strongly* recommend Google Chrome instead of Firefox. I had serious performance issues with Firefox. I have not tried the latest Edge.

If you have a gamepad, it should work with the browser.

If you want to use the keyboard instead:

* Arrow Keys: MOVE
* [F]: Fireball
* [D]: Pickup Blocks
* [S]: Drop Blocks

You can also use [SPACE] or [ENTER] for Fireballs.
