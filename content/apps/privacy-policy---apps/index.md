These apps and web services (products) are provided by Michael Conrad and are intended for use as is without guarentee of merchantibliy or fitness.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my products.

If you choose to use my apps or webservices, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.

# Information Collection and Use

The apps do not use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

Some web services use a third party oauth service for authentication. Such as Google OAuth2. Third party services may collect information used to identify you. I do not have access to the third party information except as permitted by you during authentication.

The minimal user information kept on the server is the unique OAuth2 ID#, which is specific to the oauth2 provider (such as Google), and does not identify you in a personally identifiable way.

Some web services, such as "Audio Quality Vote", need to track who is voting, and what has been voted on to operate correctly. Only the OAuth2 ID# and email address will be collected and stored on the server. Any additional information which may be requested and used, such as a profile avatar, will only be stored in your web browser and will not be transmitted to the server.

Such web services that store any user information will provide an option to delete your information, which will remove from the server all account related information and other account settings.

# Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you use my products, in a case of an error in any of the products, I collect data and information called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the products when utilizing the specific product, the time and date of your use of the product, and other statistics.

# Cookies

# Security

I value your trust in use of any of my products. Only the minimal amount of data needed is stored. Examples: For web services authentication, user id and user email, which are needed to provide personalized behavior for such web services. For Android and iOS apps, no information is collected by the apps, and they do not send any information to me about you.

# Links to Other Sites

The products may contain links to other sites. If you choose to visit one of these other sites, you will be directed to that site. 

Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

# Children’s Privacy

These products do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to take the necessary actions.
