As I walk’d through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain
place where was a Den, and I laid me down in that place to sleep; and as
I slept, I dreamed a Dream. I dreamed, and behold I saw a Man cloathed
with Rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own
house, a Book in his hand, and a great Burden upon his back. I looked,
and saw him open the Book, and read therein; and as he read, he wept and
trembled; and not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a
lamentable cry, saying “What shall I do?”

In this plight therefore he went home, and refrained himself as long as
he could, that his Wife and Children should not perceive his distress,
but he could not be silent long, because that his trouble increased:
Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his Wife and Children; and thus
he began to talk to them: *O my dear Wife,* said he, *and you the
Children of my bowels, I your dear friend, am in myself undone by reason
of a Burden that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed
that this our City (this World) will be burned with fire from Heaven; in
which fearful overthrow, both myself, with thee my Wife, and you my
sweet Babes, shall miserably come to ruine, except (the which yet I see
not) some way of escape can be found, whereby we may be delivered.*

At this his Relations were sore amazed; not for that they believed that
what he had said to them as yet was true, but because they thought that
some frenzy distemper had got into his head; therefore, it drawing
towards night, and they hoping that sleep might settle his brains, with
all haste they got him to bed: But the night was as troublesome to him
as the day; wherefore, instead of sleeping, he spent it in sighs and
tears. So, when the morning was come, they would know how he did;

He told them, *Worse and worse:* he also set to talking to them again,
but they began to be hardened: they also thought to drive away his
distemper by harsh and surly carriages to him; sometimes they would
deride, sometimes they would chide, and sometimes they would quite
neglect him: Wherefore he began to retire himself to his chamber, to
pray for and pity them, and also to condole his own misery; he would
also walk solitarily in the fields, sometimes reading, and sometimes
praying: and thus for some days he spent his time.

Now, I saw upon a time, when he was walking in the fields, that he was,
as he was wont, reading in his Book, and greatly distressed in his mind;
and as he read, he burst out, as he had done before, crying, “What shall
I do to be saved?”

I saw also that he looked this way and that way, as if he would run; yet
he stood still, because, as I perceived, he could not tell which way to
go. I looked then, and saw a man named Evangelist, coming to him, and
asked, “Wherefore dost thou cry?”

He answered, Sir, I perceive by the Book in my hand, that I am condemned
to die, and after that to come to Judgment, and I find that I am not
willing to do the first, nor able to do the second.

Then said Evangelist, “Why not willing to die, since this life is
attended with so many evils?” The Man answered, “Because I fear that
this burden that is upon my back will sink me lower than the Grave, and
I shall fall into Tophet. And, Sir, if I be not fit to go to Prison, I
am not fit to go to Judgment, and from thence to Execution; and the
thoughts of these things make me cry.”

Then said Evangelist, “If this be thy condition, why Conviction standest
thou still?” He answered, “Because I know not whither to go.” Then he
gave him a *Parchment-roll*, and there was written within, *Fly from the
wrath to come.*

The Man therefore read it, and looking upon Evangelist very carefully,
said, “Whither must I fly?” Then said Evangelist, pointing with his
finger over a very wide field, “Do you see yonder Wicket-gate?” The Man
said, “No.” Then said the other, “Do you see yonder shining Light?” He
said, “I think I do.” Then said Evangelist, “Keep that Light in your
eye, and go up directly thereto: so shalt thou see the Gate; at which,
when thou knockest, it shall be told thee what thou shalt do.”

Now he had not run far from his own door, but his Wife and Children,
perceiving it, began to cry after him to return; but the Man put his
fingers in his ears, and ran on, crying, “Life\! Life\! Eternal Life\!”
So he looked not behind him, but fled towards the middle of the Plain.

The Neighbors also came out to see him run; and as he ran, some mocked,
others threatened, and some cried after him to return; and among those
that did so, there were two that resolved to fetch him back by force.
The name of the one was *Obstinate*, and the name of the other
*Pliable*.

Now by this time the Man was got a good distance from them; but however
they were resolved to pursue him, which they did, and in a little time
they overtook him. Then said the Man, Neighbors, wherefore are you come?
They said, To persuade you to go back with us. But he said, That can by
no means be; you dwell, said he, in the City of *Destruction*, the place
also where I was born, I see it to be so; and dying there, sooner or
later, you will sink lower than the Grave, into a place that burns with
Fire and Brimstone: be content, good Neighbors, and go along with me.

Now I saw in my Dream, that just as they had ended this talk, they drew
near to a very miry *Slough*, that was in the midst of the plain ; and
they, being heedless, did both fall suddenly into the bog. The name of
the slough was *Dispond*. Here therefore they wallowed for a time, being
grievously bedaubed with the dirt; and Christian, because of the Burden
that was on his back, began to sink in the mire.

told me all this while of? If we have such ill speed at our first
setting out, what may we expect ’twixt this and our Journey’s end? May I
get out again with my life, you shall possess the brave Country alone
for me. And with that he gave a desperate struggle or two, and got out
of the mire on that side of the Slough which was next to his own house:
so away he went, and Christian saw him no more.

Wherefore Christian was left to tumble in the Slough of *Dispond* alone;
but still he endeavoured to struggle to that side of the Slough that was
still further from his own house, and next to the Wicket-gate; the which
he did, but could not get out, because of the Burden that was upon his
back: But I beheld in my Dream, that a man came to him, whose name was
*Help*, and asked him, “What he did there?”

Then I stepped to him that pluckt him out, and said, Sir, wherefore,
since over this place is the way from the City of *Destruction* to
yonder Gate, is it that this place is not mended, that poor travellers
might go thither with more security? And he said unto me, This miry
Slough is such a place as cannot be mended; it is the descent whither
the scum and filth that attends conviction for sin doth continually run,
and therefore it is called the Slough of *Dispond*; for still as the
sinner is awakened about his lost condition, there ariseth in his soul
many fears and doubts, and discouraging apprehensions, which all of them
get together, and settle in this place: And this is the reason of the
badness of this ground.

It is not the pleasure of the King that this place should remain so bad.
His labourers also have, by the direction of His Majesties Surveyors,
been for above these sixteen hundred years imployed about this patch of
ground, if perhaps it might have been mended: yea, and to my knowledge,
said he, here hath been swallowed up at least twenty thousand
cart-loads, yea, millions of wholesome instructions, that have at all
seasons been brought from all places of the King’s dominions (and they
that can tell say they are the best materials to make good ground of the
place), if so be it might have been mended, but it is the Slough of
*Dispond* still, and so will be when they have done what they can.

True, there are by the direction of the Lawgiver, certain good and
substantial steps, placed even through the very midst of this Slough;
but at such time as this place doth much spue out its filth, as it doth
against change of weather, these steps are hardly seen; or if they be,
men through the dizziness of their heads, step besides; and then they
are bemired to purpose, notwithstanding the steps be there; but the
ground is good when they are once got in at the Gate.

Now I saw in my Dream, that by this time *Pliable* was got home to his

him neighbors wise man for coming back, and some called him fool for
hazarding himself with Christian: others did mock at his cowardliness;
saying, Surely since you began to venture, I would not have been so base
to have given out for a few difficulties. So *Pliable* sat sneaking
among them. But at last he got more confidence, and then they all turned
their tales, and began to deride poor *Christian* behind his back. And
thus much concerning *Pliable*.

Now as *Christian* was walking solitary by himself, he espied one afar
off come crossing over the field to meet him; and their hap was to meet
just as they were crossing the way of each other. The gentleman’s name
that met him was *Mr. Worldly Wiseman*: he dwelt in the Town of *Carnal
Policy*, a very great Town, and also hard by from whence *Christian*
came. This man then meeting with *Christian*, and having some inkling of
him, — for *Christian*’s setting forth from the City of *Destruction*
was much noised abroad, not only in the Town where he dwelt, but also it
began to be the towntalk in some other places, — Master *Worldly
Wiseman* therefore, having some guess of him, by beholding his laborious
going, by observing his sighs and groans, and the like, began thus to
enter into some talk with *Christian*.

World. Why in yonder Village (the village is named *Morality*) there
dwells a Gentleman whose name is *Legality*, a very judicious man, and a
man of very good name, that has skill to help men off with such burdens
as thine are from their shoulders: yea, to my knowledge he hath done a
great deal of good this way; ay, and besides, he hath skill to cure
those that are somewhat crazed in their wits with their burdens. To him,
as I said, thou mayest go, and be helped presently. His house is not
quite a mile from this place, and if he should not be at home himself,
he hath a pretty young man to his Son, whose name is *Civility*, that
can do it (to speak on) as well as the old Gentleman himself; there, I
say, thou mayest be eased of thy Burden; and if thou art not minded to
go back to thy former habitation, as indeed I would not wish thee, thou
mayest send for thy Wife and Children to thee to this village, where
there are houses now stand empty, one of which thou mayest have at
reasonable rates; Provision is there also cheap and good; and that which
will make thy life the more happy is, to be sure there thou shalt live
by honest Neighbors, in credit and good fashion,

Now was Christian somewhat at a stand, but by presently he concluded, If
this be true which this Gentleman hath said, my wisest course is to take
his advice; and with that he thus farther spoke.

<span class="smallcaps">World</span>. Do you see yonder high Hill?

So *Christian* turned out of his way to go to Mr *Legality’s* house for
help; but behold, when he was got now hard by the Hill, it seemed so
high, and also that side of it that was next the wayside, did hang so
much over, that Christian was afraid to venture further, lest the Hill
should fall on his head; wherefore there he stood still, and he wot not
what to do. Also his Burden *now* seemed heavier to him than while he
was in his way. There came also flashes of fire out of the Hill, that
made Christian afraid that he should be burned. Here therefore he sweat
and did quake for fear.

And now he began to be sorry that he had taken Mr *Worldly Wiseman’s*
counsel. And with that he saw *Evangelist* coming to meet him; at the
sight also of whom he began to blush for shame. So *Evangelist* drew
nearer and nearer; and coming up to him, he looked upon him with a
severe and dreadful countenance, and thus began to reason with
*Christian*.

Sir, that you set me; which way, said he, will direct you to a
Gentleman’s house that hath skill to take off these Burdens: So I
believed him, and turned out of that way into this, if haply I might be

know not what to do.

<span class="smallcaps">Evan</span>. Then, said *Evangelist*, stand
still a little, that I may shew thee the words of God. So he stood
trembling. Then said Evangelist, *See that ye refuse not him that
speaketh; for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on Earth,
much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh
from Heaven.* He said moreover, *Now the just shall live by faith: but
if any man draws back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.* He also
did thus apply them, *Thou art the man that art running into this
misery, thou hast begun to reject the counsel of the Most High, and to
draw back thy foot from the way of peace, even almost to the hazarding
of thy perdition.*

Then *Christian* fell down at his foot as dead, crying, Wo is me, for I
am undone: At the sight of which, *Evangelist* caught him by the right
hand, saying, “All manner of sin and blasphemies shall be forgiven unto
men;” <span>\[</span>Matthew 12:31<span>\]</span>. “Be not faithless,
but believing.” <span>\[</span>John 20:27<span>\]</span>. Then did
*Christian* again a little revive, and stood up trembling, as at first,
before *Evangelist*.

Then *Evangelist* proceeded, saying, Give more earnest heed to the
things that I shall tell thee of. I will now shew thee who it was that
deluded thee, and who it was also to whom he sent thee. The man that met
thee is one *Worldly Wiseman*, and rightly is he so called: partly
because he savoureth only the doctrine of this world, (therefore he
always goes to the Town of *Morality* to church); and partly because he
loveth that doctrine best, for it saveth him from the Cross. And because
he is of this carnal temper, therefore he seeketh to prevent my ways,
though right.

First, Thou must abhor his turning thee out of the way; yea, and thine
own consenting thereto, because this is to reject the counsel of God for
the sake of the counsel of a *Worldly Wiseman*. The Lord says, *Strive
to enter in at the strait gate* <span>\[</span>Luke
13:24<span>\]</span>*,* the gate to which I sent thee; *for strait is
the gate that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it*
<span>\[</span>Matthew 7:13-14<span>\]</span>*.* From this little
Wicket-gate, and from the way thereto, hath this wicked man turned thee,
to the bringing of thee almost to destruction; hate therefore his
turning thee out of the way, and abhor thyself for hearkening to him.

Secondly, Thou must abhor his labouring to render the Cross odious unto
thee; for thou art to *prefer it before the treasures of Egypt*
<span>\[</span>Hebrews 11:25-26<span>\]</span>*.* Besides, the King of
Glory hath told thee, that *he that will save his life shall lose it*:
and He that comes after him, and hates not his father, and mother, and
wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and his own life
also, he cannot be my Disciple. <span>\[</span>Mark 13:35, John 12:25,
Matthew 10:39, Luke 14:26<span>\]</span> I say therefore, for a man to
labour to persuade thee, that that shall be thy death, without which,
the Truth hath said, thou canst not have eternal life; This doctrine
thou must abhor.

He to whom thou was sent for ease, being by name *Legality*, is the Son
of the Bond-woman which now is, and is in bondage with her children;
woman and is in a mystery this Mount *Sinai*, which thou hast feared
will fall on thy head. Now if she with her children are in bondage, how
canst thou expect by them to be made free? This *Legality* therefore is
not able to set thee free from thy Burden. No man was as yet ever rid of
his Burden by him ; no, nor ever is like to be: ye cannot be justified
by the Works of the Law; for by the deeds of the Law; no man living can
be rid of his Burden: therefore, Mr *Worldly Wiseman* is an alien, and
Mr *Legality* a cheat; and for his son *Civility*, notwithstanding his
simpering looks, he is but a hypocrite and can not help thee. Believe
me, there is nothing in all this noise, that thou hast heard of this
sottish man, but a design to beguile thee of thy Salvation, by turning
thee from the way in which I had set thee. After this *Evangelist*
called aloud to the Heavens for confirmation of what he had said; and
with that there came words and fire out of the Mountain under which poor
*Christian* stood, that made the hair of his flesh stand. The words were
thus pronounced, *As many as are the works of the Law are under the
curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.*

Now *Christian* looked for nothing but death, and began to cry out
lamentably, even cursing the time in which he met with Mr *Worldly
Wiseman*, still calling himself a thousand fools for hearkening to his
counsel: he also was greatly ashamed to think that this Gentleman’s
arguments, flowing only from the flesh, should have that prevalency with
him as to cause him to forsake the right way. This done, he applied
himself again to *Evangelist* in words and sense as follows.

<span class="smallcaps">Chr</span>. Sir, what think you? Is there hopes?
May I now go back and go up to the Wicket-gate? Shall I not be abandoned
for this, and sent back from thence ashamed? I am sorry I have hearkened
to this man’s counsel : But may my sin be forgiven?

<span class="smallcaps">Evan</span>. Then said *Evangelist* to him, Thy
sin is very great, for by it thou hast committed two evils: thou hast
forsaken the way that is good, to tread in forbidden paths; yet will the
man at the Gate receive thee, for he has good-will for men; only, said
he, take heed that thou turn not aside again, lest thou perish from the
way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. <span>\[</span>Psalms

Then did *Christian* address himself to go back; and *Evangelist*, after
he had kissed him, gave him one smile, and bid him God speed. So he went
on with haste, neither spake he to any man by the way; nor if any man
asked him, would he vouchsafe them an answer. He went like one that was
all the while treading on forbidden ground, and could by no means think
himself safe, till again he was got into the way which he left to follow
Mr *Worldly Wiseman’s* counsel. So in process of time *Christian* got up
to the Gate. Now over the Gate there was written, *Knock and it shall be
opened unto you.* <span>\[</span>Matthew 7:7<span>\]</span>.

So when *Christian* was stepping in, the other gave him a pull. Then
said *Christian*, What means that? The other told him, A little distance
from this Gate, there is erected a strong Castle, of which Beelzebub is
the Captain; from thence both he and they that are with him shoot arrows
at those that come up to this Gate, if haply they may die before they
can enter in. Then said *Christian*, I rejoice and tremble. So when he

not help him off with his Burden that was upon his back; for as yet he
had not got rid thereof, nor could he by any means get it off without
help.

Then *Christian* began to gird up his loins, and to address himself to
his Journey. So the other told him, That by that he was gone some
distance from the Gate, he would come at the house of the *Interpreter*,
at whose door he should knock, and he would shew him excellent things.
Then *Christian* took his leave of his Friend, and he again bid him God

commanded his man to light the Candle, and bid *Christian* follow him,
so he had him into a private room, and bid his man open a door; the
which when he had done, *Christian* saw the Picture of a very grave
Person hang up against the wall; and this was the fashion of it. It had
eyes lifted up to Heaven, the best of Books in his hand, the Law of
Truth was written upon his lips, the The World was behind his back. It
stood as if it pleaded with men, and a Crown of Gold did hang over his

and nurse them himself when they are born. And whereas thou seest him
with his eyes lift up to Heaven, the best of Books in his hand, and the
Law of Truth writ on his lips, it is to shew thee that his work is to
know and unfold dark things to sinners; even as also thou seest him
stand as if he pleaded with men; and whereas thou picture seest the
World as cast behind him, and that a Crown hangs over his head, that is
to shew thee that slighting and despising the things that are present,
for the love that he hath to his Master’s service, he is sure in the
world that comes next to have Glory for his reward. Now, said the
*Interpreter*, I have shewed thee this Picture first, because the Man
whose Picture this is, is the only man whom the Lord of the place
whither thou art picture going, hath authorized to be thy guide in all
difficult places thou mayest meet with in the way; wherefore take good
heed to what I have shewed thee, and bear well in thy mind what thou
hast seen, lest in thy Journey thou meet with some that pretend to lead
thee right, but their way goes down to death.

Then he took him by the hand, and led him into a very large *Parlour*

Now when he began to sweep, the dust began so abundantly to fly about,
that *Christian* had almost therewith been choaked. Then said the

sprinkle the Room; the which when she had done, it was swept and

<span class="smallcaps">Inter</span>. The *Interpreter* answered, This
*parlour* is the heart of a man that was never sanctified by the sweet
Grace of the Gospel: the *dust* is his Original Sin and inward
Corruptions, that have defiled the whole man. He that began to sweep at
first, is the Law; but she that brought water, and did sprinkle it, is
the Gospel. Now, whereas thou sawest that so soon as the first began to
sweep, the dust did so fly about that the Room by him could not be
cleansed, but that thou wast almost choaked there with; this is to shew
thee, that the Law, instead of cleansing the heart (by its working) from
sin, doth revive, put strength into, and increase it in the soul, even
as it doth discover and forbid it, for it doth not give power to subdue.

Again, as thou sawest the Damsel sprinkle the room with Water, upon
which it was cleansed with pleasure; this is to shew thee, that when the
Gospel comes in the sweet and precious influences thereof to the heart,
then I say, even as thou sawest the Damsel lay the dust by sprinkling
the floor with Water, so is sin vanquished and subdued, and the soul
made clean, through the faith of it, and consequently fit for the King
of Glory to inhabit. <span>\[</span>John 15:3, Acts 15:9, John

Then I saw that one came to Passion, and brought him a bag of treasure,
and poured it down at his feet, the which he took up and rejoiced
therein; and withal, laughed Patience to scorn. But I beheld but a
while, and he had lavished all away, and had nothing left him but Rags.

<span class="smallcaps">Inter</span>. So he said, These two Lads are
figures: *Passion*, of the men of this world; and *Patience*, of the men
of that which is to come; for as here thou seest, *Passion* will have
all now this year, that is to say, in this world; so are the men of this
world: they must have all their good things now, they cannot stay till
next year, that is, until the next world, for their portion of good.

That proverb, *A Bird in the Hand is worth two in the Bush*, is of more
authority with them than are all the Divine testimonies of the good of
the world hand to come. But as thou sawest that he had quickly lavished
all away, and had presently left him nothing but Rags; so will it be
with all such men at the end of this world.

<span class="smallcaps">Inter</span>. Nay, you may add another, to wit,
the first must glory of the *next* world will never wear out; but
*these* are suddenly gone, Therefore *Passion* had not but things so
much reason to laugh at *Patience*, because he had his good things
first, as *Patience* will have to laugh at *Passion*, because he had his
best things last; for *first* must give place to *last*, because *last*
must have his time to come: but last gives place to nothing; for there
is not another to succeed. He therefore that hath his portion *first*,
must needs have a time to spend it; but he that hath his portion *last*,
must have it lastingly; therefore it is said of *Dives, In thy lifetime
thou receivedst thy good things, and likewise* Lazarus *evil things; but
now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.* <span>\[</span>Luke

which are seen are* Temporal; *but the things that are not temporal seen
are* Eternal. <span>\[</span>2 Corinthians 4:18<span>\]</span> But
though this be so, yet since things present and our fleshly appetite are
such near neighbors one to another; and, again, because things to come
and carnal sense are such strangers one to another; therefore it is that
the first of these so suddenly fell into *amity*, and that *distance* is
so continued between the second. <span>\[</span>Romans

# Notes

## Not an exact translation

This is not an exact translation between the two languages. In many
places the Cherokee text “skips” details or has other differences to
simplify the translation process or may have additional information
added related to context.

### Examples:

1.  ᎠᏴᏍᎩᏂ ᎠᏲᎱᎯᏍᏗᏱ ᏗᎦᏚᎲ …
    
    1.  ᎠᏴ (I) + ᏍᎩᏂ (but), ᎠᏲᎱᏍᏗᏱ (place of death), ᏗᎦᏚᎲ (city), …
    
    2.  But it is I the death place city …
    
    3.  I am a man that am come from the City of Destruction
        
        *In this example “I am a man” has become “But it is I” and “City
        of Destruction” has become “City of Death”.*

2.  ᎦᎢᏒᏃ ᎢᎾᎨ ᎠᏂ ᎡᎶᎯ …
    
    1.  ᎦᎢᏒ (I was walking) + Ꮓ (And) ᎢᎾᎨ (wilderness) ᎠᏂ (here) ᎡᎶᎯ
        (world) …
    
    2.  And I was walking the wilderness here (of) the world …
    
    3.  As I walk’d through the wilderness of this world …
        
        *In this example “walk’d through” has become “was walking” and
        “of this” has become “here”*

3.  … ᏍᏗᎪᎵᏯ ᎯᎠ ᎪᏪᎵ ᏥᏥᏁᎭ.
    
    1.  … ᏍᏗᎪᎵᏯ ᎯᎠ ᎪᏪᎵ ᏥᏥᏁᎭ.
    
    2.  … let you two read this book which-I-am-holding
    
    3.  … read it so, if you will, in my Book.
        
        *In this example “Read it so, if you will” has become “Let you
        two read” and “in my book” has become “this book
        which-I-am-holding”.*

## \-ᎥᎩ, -ᎥᎢ, -Ꭵ, -ᎡᎢ

The following shows the final suffixes *-vgi*, *-vi*, *-v*, *-ei* as
they were used in 1844. Even though it is not reflected in a lot of
modern teaching materials, there are communities which still use the -ᎥᎩ
suffix.

  - <span>-Ꭵ</span>  
    <span>\[</span>-v<span>\]</span> “did or was doing”

  - <span>-ᎥᎩ</span>  
    <span>\[</span>-vgi<span>\]</span> “did or was doing (with my
    personal knowledge or consciousness)”

  - <span>-ᎡᎢ</span>  
    <span>\[</span>-ei<span>\]</span> “did or was doing (without my
    personal knowledge or consciousness)”

  - <span>-ᎥᎢ</span>  
    <span>\[</span>-vi<span>\]</span> “his doing (already done)” *(This
    form should be treated as a noun in the text.)*

### Examples:

  - ᎧᏁᎪᎢ - “He is usually or on certain occasions speaking.”
    
      - ᎧᏁᎬ - “He was speaking.”
    
      - ᎧᏁᎬᎩ - “He was speaking (with my personal knowledge or
        consciousness).”
    
      - ᎧᏁᎨᎢ - “He was speaking (without my personal knowledge or
        consciousness).”
    
      - ᎧᏁᎬᎢ - “His word (that he was speaking).” *(This form should be
        treated as a noun.)*

  - ᎤᏁᏨ - “He spoke.”
    
      - ᎤᏁᏦᎢ - “He has spoken (habitually or on certain occasions).”
    
      - ᎤᏁᏨᎩ - “He spoke (with my personal knowledge or consciousness).”
    
      - ᎤᏁᏤᎢ - “He spoke (without my personal knowledge or
        consciousness).”
    
      - ᎤᏁᏤᏍᏗ - “He will have spoke.”
    
      - ᎤᏁᏨᎢ - “His word (that he spoke).” *(This form should be treated
        as a noun.)*

*Cherokee Messenger*, pg 30-32

## ᎨᏒᎢ, ᎨᏐᎢ …

The following indicates the main meanings for some of the more common
forms of “is” as found in the text.

  - <span>ᎨᏒ</span>  
    “was”

  - <span>ᎨᏐᎢ</span>  
    “is usually, is under certain conditions”

  - <span>ᎨᏒᎩ</span>  
    “was (with personal knowledge, or consciousness)”

  - <span>ᎨᏎᎢ</span>  
    “was (without personal knowledge, or consciousness)”

  - <span>ᎨᏎᏍᏗ</span>  
    “will be”

  - <span>ᎨᏒᎢ</span>  
    “being”

*Cherokee Messenger*, pg 30

## \-ᏍᎩᏂ

This suffix is used extensively throughout the text.

*This postfix is typically translated as ‘but’; when attached to a
question word, however, it often expresses ‘I wonder’.*

*A Reference Grammar of Oklahoma Cherokee (2015)* pg 209.

### Examples:

1.  From the text:
    
    1.  … ᎪᎱᏍᏗᏉᏍᎩᏂ ᎤᎵᏍᏓᏏ ᎤᏓᏅᏛ ᎠᏁᎵᏍᎬᎩ
        
        … but because they thought that some frenzy distemper had got
        into his head
        
        ᎪᎱᏍᏗ (something) + Ꮙ (just) + ᏍᎩᏂ (but)
    
    2.  … ᎯᎠᏃ ᏄᏪᏒᎩ, Ꭷ, ᎰᏩᏉ, ᎦᏕᎶᎣᏍᎦᏍᎩᏂ ᎠᏂ ᎪᏪᎵ ᏣᏆᏒᎦᏔ
        
        … He answered, Sir, I perceive by the Book in my hand, that I am
        condemned to die
        
        ᎦᏕᎶᎣᏍᎦ (I am finding out) + ᏍᎩᏂ (but)

2.  From the *Cherokee English Dictionary* (1972)
    
    1.  ᎦᏙᏍᎩᏂ ᎤᏍᏗ ᏄᏩᏁ ᏥᏚᎦᏍᏗᎭ. *(See ᏚᎦᏍᏗᎭ, pg 87)*
        
        I wonder what’s causing him to vomit.
        
        ᎦᏙ (what) + ᏍᎩᏂ (but)
    
    2.  ᎠᏣᎳᎩ ᎤᏴᏜ “ᏳᏂᏴᎭ” Ꮭ ᎤᏴᏜ ᏱᎦᏂᏱᏍᎪᎢ, ᎤᏴᏜᏍᎩᏂ ᎤᎬᏫᏍᏳᏐ ᎤᏂᏱᏍᎪᎢ. *(See ᎤᏴᏜ,
        pg 169)*
        
        Whenever a Cherokee “catches” a cold, he doesn’t catch the cold;
        rather, the cold catches him.
        
        ᎤᏴᏜ (cold) + ᏍᎩᏂ (but)

*Just because there is a “but” in the Cherokee text does not mean there
will be a matching “but”, “however”, etc, in the English text. The
reverse holds true as well.*

## Wordlist

Here are a few vocabulary words selected to help with the text. Where a
term has been included because of a dialectial difference between the
Pilgrim’s Progress and the *Cherokee English Dictionary* the *Cherokee
English Dictionary* entry is included for comparison.

Additionally, many clitics and word endings are also different from what
you will find in the *Cherokee English Dictionary* and some of these
have also been included for reference to assist the student.
