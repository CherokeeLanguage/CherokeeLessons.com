For the serious student of the Cherokee language.  
<!-- more -->
This dual language book contains each Cherokee language verse in full Syllabary alternating with the corresponding English language verse from "Young's Literal Translation" for side by side comparison between the Cherokee and the English to help in learning the meanings of the words in each Cherokee verse and how they all fit together.  
  
The "Young's Literal Translation" was chosen because it is more literal and faithful translation of the Greek of the source texts and improves on the student's ability to see how the Cherokee is constructed.
