Rabbit in the moon, rabbit in the moon, why are you going? “ᎦᎵᏘ. ᏩᎭᏯ ᎠᏆᏰᏍᏗ ᎤᏚᎵ. ᎨᏡᎲᏍᎦ...” “I am running away. The wolf wants to eat me. He is howling...” This is an example of one of the many stories within that are written in a fashion similar to what you would find in an English reader designed for reading to a young child. Includes both a special section on grammar structures introduced in this volume and a complete vocabulary to assist with word lookup.
