These five delightfully entertaining stories are for the beginning student of the Cherokee Language.  
  
Each mini-comic is immediately followed by an approximate translation into English.  
  
While these stories are not traditional Cherokee stories, the use of comics permits the use of the language in settings that provide context, which should greatly enhance retention and comprehension of the language demonstrated.  
  
The majority of the vocabulary used in these mini-comics has been taken from the 1974 “Cherokee English Dictionary”.  
  
Each story story uses increasingly more complex grammar rules.
