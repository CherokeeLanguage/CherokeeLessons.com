Language and culture which are not shared and taught openly and freely will die. If our language and culture die, as a people, so do we. 

This is an introductory course to the GRAMMAR of the Cherokee Language and is not a "conversational" sentences memorization course.

Enrollment is open and the coursework is self-directed. Students are encouraged to help each other.

The material is based on "Cherokee Language Lessons, First Edition" published under the name "Michael Joyner".
