#### Learning the shapes.

This exercise covers “Ꭰ (a)”, “Ꭱ (e)”, “Ꭲ (i)”, “Ꭳ (o)”, “Ꭴ (u)”, “Ꭵ
(v)” and “Ꭶ (ga)”.

Estimated time: 5 minutes.

The purpose of this exercise is to learn the hand strokes needed for
writing each of the letters. Write the following line out six times.
Take your time and draw each letter step by step as depicted in the
following figure. *Do not write out the English pronunciation next to
each letter*. Instead as you write each letter, say aloud its name while
keeping the tip of your tongue against the backside of your lower front
teeth.
