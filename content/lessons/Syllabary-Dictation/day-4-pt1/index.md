Morning Practice

#### Learning the shapes.

This exercise covers “Ꮚ (gwu)”, “Ꮛ (gwv)”, “Ꮜ (sa)”, “Ꮝ (s)”, “Ꮞ (se)”,
“Ꮟ (si)”, and “Ꮠ (so)”.

Estimated time: 5 minutes.
<!-- more -->
The purpose of this exercise is to learn the hand strokes needed for
writing each of the letters. Write the following line out six times.
Take your time and draw each letter step by step as depicted in the
following figure. *Do not write out the English pronunciation next to
each letter*. Instead as you write each letter, say aloud its name while
keeping the tip of your tongue against the backside of your lower front
teeth.

☞ *It is very important when writing the letter “Ꮚ” to draw the middle
bump curved towards the right and to draw the top curve stopping very
close to the left where the letter starts. If you don’t write the letter
this way, it might be mistaken for either of the letters “Ꮗ (gwe)” or “Ꮿ
(ya)”.*

#### Recognition Practice.

☞ *Be careful not to confuse “Ꮗ (gwe)” and “Ꮚ (gwu)” with each other in
the following exercise.*

Estimated time: 10 minutes.

__Handwrite__ the English pronunciation for each of the following Cherokee letters:
