writing each of the letters. Write the following line out six times.
Take your time and draw each letter step by step as depicted in the
following figure. *Do not write out the English pronunciation next to

keeping the tip of your tongue against the backside of your lower front
teeth.

☞ *It is very important when writing the letter “Ꮗ” to draw the top
curve pointed downwards stopping very close the middle bump. If you
don’t write the letter this way, it might be mistaken for either of the
letters “Ꮚ (gwu)” or “Ꮿ (ya)”.*

Estimated time: 10 minutes.
