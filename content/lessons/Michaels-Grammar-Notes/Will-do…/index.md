If you take the *Remote Past* form and then add the special prefix “dạ-”
and replace the “-vi” ending with “-ị” you create the *Completive
Future* form. If the *Present Tense* form uses “Set A” pronouns, then
use “Set A” pronouns and not “Set B” pronouns. ☞ *This indicates much
the same meaning as the English “will… ” forms that do not use “be…
ing”.*

  - Basic Pronunciation Rules:
    
      - “dạ-” is inserted directly after where “de-” is usually
        inserted.
        
          - If there is a “de-” it changes to become “do-”.
    
      - If “dạ-” is used before “e-”, “o-”, “u-” or “v-” it becomes
        “dạy-”.
    
      - If “dạ-” is used before an “a-” they combine to become “dv-”. ☞
        *A general sound combining rule for Cherokee is to merge two “a”
        sounds that come together into a single long “v”.*
    
      - If “dạ-” is used before an “i-” the “i-” is replaced and “dạ-”
        becomes “da¹-”.
    
      - If “dạ-” is used before an “h-” they combine together and become
        “t-”.
        
          - *Additional pronunciation rules will be provided as needed
            as part of your exercise material.*

very important that if you are wanting to express something in Cherokee
that would be expressed in English with “will be… ing” to use the Future
Progressive form instead\!*
