    \[-⁴ɂị, -⁴yị\] “Place of. Location is usually found at.”

This ending allows you to create new words that indicate a place or
location.

When added to a word that ends in an “-a”, the “-a” usually changes into
an “-v” though there are a few words that the “-a” changes into an “-o”
instead. Unless otherwise instructed, you should change the “-a” into an
“-v”.

understand you as indicating “On.” or “In.” instead of “Location.”.*
