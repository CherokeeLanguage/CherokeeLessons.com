To indicate that something is about to take place. Add the “-ᎢᏗ” suffix
to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Past Tense</span> form.

*Use “Set B” pronouns.*

  - \-ᎢᏗ  
    \[-Ꭲ⁴Ꮧ\] “is just about to…”
    
      - \-ᎢᏗᏒᎢ  
        \[-i²di²³sv²³ɂi\] “Was about to… a while ago.”
    
      - \-ᎢᏗᏍᎪᎢ  
        \[-i²di²³sgo³ɂi\] “Habitually is about…”
    
      - \-ᎢᏕᎾ  
        \[-i²de⁴na\] “Let now be about to… ”

Additionally, the *Cherokee Messenger pg 95 “Immediate Future Tense”*,
indicates that the suffix “-ᎢᏗ” may be used in combination with the
“with intent” suffix (-ᎢᏐᎢ):

  - \-ᎢᏗᏐᎢ  
    \[-i²di²³so³ɂi\] “Is just about to… (with intent) when… ”.
    
      - \-ᎢᏗᏒ  
        \[-i²di²³sv\] “Was just about to… (with intent)”
    
      - \-ᎢᏗᏎᏍᏗ  
        \[-i²di²³sẹ³sdi\] “Will be about to… (with intent)”
    
      - \-ᎢᏗᏒᎢ  
        \[-i²di²³sv²³ɂi\] “(His) being about to… (with intent)” *Verbal
        Noun.*
