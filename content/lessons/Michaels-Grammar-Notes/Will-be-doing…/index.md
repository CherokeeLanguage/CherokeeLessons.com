If you take the *Present Habitual* form and replace the ending “-o³ɂi”
with “-e³sdi” you end up with the *Future Progressive* form. This form
indicates an action that will be ongoing at a certain point in the
future. ⚠ *The tone is important.*

☞ *Note how this matches “ᎨᏐᎢ (gesoi) - often is being” and “ᎨᏎᏍᏗ
(gesesdi) - will be being”.*

Examples:

  - ᏥᏆᏘᏍᎪᎢ. Jigowhtisgoi. “I am often seeing it.”
    
      - ᏥᎪᏩᏘᏍᎨᏍᏗ. Jigowhtisgesdi. “I will be seeing it.”

  - ᏣᏚᎵᏍᎪᎢ. Jadulisgoi. “You are often wanting it.”
    
      - ᏣᏚᎵᏍᎨᏍᏗ. Jadulisgesdi. “You will be wanting it.”

  - ᎤᏚᎵᏍᎪᎢ. Udulisgoi. “He/she is often wanting it.”
    
      - ᎤᏚᎵᏍᎨᏍᏗ. Udulisgesdi. “He/she will be wanting it.”

⚠ *Note that “will be… ing” is used in all of these examples. It is very
important that if you are wanting to express something in Cherokee that
would be expressed in English with “will… ” but not “will be… ing” to
use the Completive Future form instead\!*
