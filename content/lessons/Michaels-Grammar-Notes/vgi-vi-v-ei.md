The following shows the final suffixes -vgi, -vi, -v, -ei as they were used in 1844. Even though it is not reflected in a lot of modern teaching materials, there are communities which still use the -ᎥᎩ suffix.

-ᎥᎩ [-vgi] “did or was doing (with my personal knowledge or consciousness)”

-ᎡᎢ [-ei] “did or was doing (without my personal knowledge or consciousness)”
