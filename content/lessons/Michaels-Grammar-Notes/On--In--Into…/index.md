  - \-Ꭿ  
    \[-⁴hị\] “On. In. Into.”

This ending allows you to indicate “on or in” for the word you modify.

When added to a word that ends in “-a”, the “-a” changes into an “-o”.

☞ *Make sure to always say the part before the final “-hi” with a high
rising tone, even if you drop the final “-hi” as part of informal
speech.*

☞ *Depending on context, if you drop the final “-hi” some speakers might
understand you as indicating “Location.” instead of “On.” or “In.”.*
