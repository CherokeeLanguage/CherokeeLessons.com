  - Ꮒ- + Ꮥ- becomes ᏂᏗ-

☞ The Ꮒ- prefix can indicate “*will have already begun”* or *“will have
already occurred”* when used with the habitual form.

*You are indicating a future event happening alongside another future
event. The events are “beside” or “next to” each other.*

This requires replacing the “-oi” ending with “-esdi”.

Examples:

  - ᎠᏗᏍᎪᎢ Adisgoi. He/she usually says it.
    
      - ᎾᏗᏍᎨᏍᏗ. Nadisgesdi. *Ni- -adisg- -esdi.*
        
          - “He/she will already be saying it. He/she will already have
            said it.”

  - ᎠᎩᏍᎪᎢ. Agisgoi. He/she usually eats.
    
      - ᏥᎪᏩᏘᎭ ᎾᎩᏍᎨᏍᏗ. Jigowhtiha nagisgesdi. *Ni- -agisg- -esdi.*
        
          - “When I see him, he will already be eating. When I see him,
            he will already have eaten.”
        
          - *The concept of “when” is implied because we are talking
            about a first event in relation to a second event.*
