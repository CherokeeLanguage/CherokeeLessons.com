If you want to be able to describe something based on a state of being,
like “jumpy” for “jumping” or “hungry” for “is hungry”, you can often
take the *Past Tense* form and use the suffix “-Ꭵ⁴Ꭲ”. These new word
forms use the “Ꮧ-” prefix rules for making plurals and must be inflected
for person. The word order normally reverses as the new word with the
“-Ꭵ⁴Ꭲ” suffix is a descriptive word and normally goes in front of
what it is describing. *Keeping the “⁴” tone is very important.*

      - ᏧᏂᏲᏏᏍᎬᎢ ᎠᏂᏧᏣ. The hungry boys.

      - ᏣᎵᏘᏒᎢ ᏂᎯ. You appear flighty. You look like you want to run
        away.

  - ᎦᏚ ᎤᏩᏚᏁ. He baked the bread.
    
      - ᎤᏩᏚᏅᎢ ᎦᏚ. Baked bread.

*While not all verbs can be turned into descriptive words this way, many
can.*
