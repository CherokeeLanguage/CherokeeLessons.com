Related to the previous discussion for “Going To” is the related idea of
doing something when doing another thing. There are three main forms
which cover “when he goes he does”, “when he went he did”, and “when he
goes he will” which will be shown by example.

#### “go and do”

This form is created replacing “-ᎥᎢ” with “-ᎡᎾ” \[-e³na\] on the
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">past tense</span> form and adding
the prefix “Ᏹ-”.

Example:

  - ᎤᏪᏴ ᏱᎾᏛᏁᎴᎾ ᏥᎪᏩᏘᏍᎪ. “When he goes to the creek to do it I see him.”
    
      - *ᏱᎾᏛᏁᎴᎾ. Ᏹ + Ꮒ + Ꭰ + ᎤᏛᏁᎸᎢ + ᎡᎾ.*

#### “went and did”

This form is created by replacing “-ᎥᎢ” with “-ᎡᎾ” \[-e³na\] on the
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">past tense</span> form. This form
does not add the prefix “Ᏹ-”.

Example:

  - ᎠᏫ ᎢᎪᏗ ᎤᏴᏞᎾ, ᎠᏫ ᏩᏯ ᎤᎪᏩᏛᏗ ᎤᏄᎸᏁ ᏍᎩᏅᏳᏍᏗ ᏩᏯ ᎠᏫ ᎤᏩᏯᎡ. “When the deer went
    to enter the prairie, the deer failed to see the wolf so the wolf
    ate the deer.”
    
      - *ᎤᏴᏞᎾ. ᎤᏴᏢᎢ + ᎡᎾ.*

#### “will go and do”

This form is created replacing “-ᎥᎢ” with “-ᎡᎾ” \[-e³na\] on the
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">past tense</span> form. This form
does not add the prefix “Ᏹ-”. This form uses “Set A” pronouns if the
present tense uses “Set A” pronouns. *This form is identical to “went
and did” in some circumstances and context must be used to tell them
apart.*

Example:

  - ᎨᏎᏍᏗ ᎠᏫ ᎢᎪᏗ ᎠᏴᏞᎾ, ᎠᏫ ᏩᏯ ᎤᎪᏩᏛᏗ ᎤᏄᎸᏁ. When the deer goes to enter the
    prairie the deer will fail to see the wolf. *Literal: “It will be
    when the deer went to enter the prairie, the deer failed to see the
    wolf.”*
    
      - *ᎠᏴᏞᎾ. Ꭰ + ᎤᏴᏢᎢ + ᎡᎾ.*
