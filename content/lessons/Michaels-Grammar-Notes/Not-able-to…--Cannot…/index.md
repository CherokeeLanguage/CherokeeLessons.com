*See also “Able to… ” and “Able to if”.*

For negative conditional ability, take the
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Immediate Tense</span> stem and
add “Ꮭ” and use prefix “ᏴᎦ-”
<!-- more -->
*Note: ᏴᎦ combines with an ᎢᏥ to become ᏴᎨᏥ, combines other Ꭲ’s to
become ᏴᎦ-, combines with an Ꭰ sound to become ᏴᎬ-, and combines with an
Ꭴ sound to become ᏴᎫ-.*

Examples:

  - Ꮭ ᏴᎦᏥᏁᎩ “I cannot speak.” “I cannot speak if… ”

  - Ꮭ ᏴᎦᎯᏁᎩ “You cannot speak.” “You cannot speak if… ”

  - Ꮭ ᏴᎬᏂᏁᎩ “They cannot speak.” “They cannot speak if… ”

*While “Ꮭ” is commonly used with this prefix combination, its use is not
required.*
