To indicate that something is being done to someone else or being done
for someone else, you take the
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">past tense</span> form and add
one of the following special “doing for” endings.

*You should only use pronouns that indicate animate to animate
relationships when using this ending.*
<!-- more -->
  - \-ᎡᎭ  
    \[-e²ha\] “is doing for… is doing to… ”
    
      - \-ᎡᎸᎢ  
        \[-e²lv²³ɂi\] “did for… did to… ”
    
      - \-ᎡᎰᎢ  
        \[-e²ho³ɂi\] “habitually does for… habitually does to… ”
    
      - \-Ꮟ  
        \[-¹si\] “let be doing for… let be doing to… ”
        
          - \-ᎡᎵ  
            \[-e²li\] “just did for… just doing to… ”
    
      - \-ᎡᏗ  
        \[-eh³di\] “to do for… to do to… ”

Examples:

  - ᏄᏛᏁᎸᎢ. “He did it.”
    
      - ᎾᏆᏛᏁᎴᎭ. “He is doing it for me.”
        
          - *Ꮒ + ᎠᎩ + ᎤᏛᏁᎸᎢ + ᎡᎭ.*

  - ᏚᏟᏆᏗᏅᏒᎢ. “He turned it over.”
    
      - ᏙᏓᏣᏟᏆᏗᏅᏎᎵ. “He will turn it over for you.”
        
          - *Ꮧ + Ꮣ + Ꮳ + ᎤᏟᏆᏗᏅᏒᎢ + ᎡᎵ.*

  - ᏅᏯ ᎤᎩᏒᎢ. “He got a rock.”
    
      - ᏅᏯ ᏥᎩᏎᎸᎢ. “I got a rock for him.”
        
          - *Ꮵ + ᎤᎩᏒᎢ + ᎡᎸᎢ.*

On some verbs one can add the prefix “Ꮻ-” to indicate “to” as in
“towards someone or at someone”.

Example:

  - ᏕᎪᏪᎵᎠ. “He is writing them.”
    
      - ᏕᎪᏪᎳᏁᎭ. “He is writing them for him.” - *ᏕᎪᏪᎳᏅᎢ + ᎡᎭ. (Writing
        them on his behalf.)*
    
      - ᏫᏗᎪᏪᎳᏁᎭ. “He is writing them to him.” - *Ꮻ + ᏕᎪᏪᎳᏅᎢ + ᎡᎭ.
        (Writing them for him to send to him.)*

These endings are also used to indicate “something bad happening by an
unspecified actor to people” when used with verbs that indicate or could
indicate something negative happening.

Example:

  - ᏓᏆᎴᎳ ᎤᏲᏤ. “The car broke.”
    
      - ᏓᏆᎴᎳ ᎤᏲᏤᎴ. “The car broke down on him.” - *Literally: The car
        broke for him.*
        
          - ᎤᏲᏨᎢ + ᎡᎸᎢ.
