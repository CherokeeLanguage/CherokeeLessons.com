The special prefix “nị-” is used quite often in Cherokee for various meanings.

Pronunciation

The Basic pronunciation rules for Ꮒ- “nị-” are as follows:

• It is added before the bound pronoun.

– If any plural markers Ꮥ- “de-”, Ꮧ- “di-”, Ꭸ- “ge-”, or Ꭶ- “ga-” are used, add it before them.

∗ Ꮥ- “de-” becomes Ꮧ- “dị-” after Ꮒ- “nị-” unless followed by a high tone. (Ꮒ- + Ꮥ- becomes ᏂᏗ-)

• If Ꮒ- “nị-” is followed by a vowel, the “-ị-” is dropped.

• If Ꮒ- “nị-” is followed by an “-h-” sound, the “-h-” sound combines with the Ꮒ- “nị-” sound to give “hn-”.

• If Ꮒ- “nị-” is used on the infinitive “to be” form or on any word created out of the infinitive, such as the “Result of Doing” form, it changes sound and becomes Ꭲ- “i-” before a consonant or “iy-” before a vowel. ☞ Some speakers will remove the leading “i-” off of “iy-” , even in formal speech.
