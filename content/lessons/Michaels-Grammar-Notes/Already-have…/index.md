  - Ꮒ- + Ꮥ- becomes ᏂᏗ-

☞ The Ꮒ- prefix can indicate “*had already begun”* or “*had already
occurred”* when used with the past tense form.

*You are indicating a past event happening alongside another past event.
The events are “beside” or “next to” each other.*

This requires a change of the ending to “-oi”.

            was already eating.”
        
          - *The concept of “when” is implied because we are talking
            about a first event in relation to a second event.*
