The prefix Ꮵ- is used to refer to either a known and experienced point
in time, or when referring back to something specific that was
previously mentioned. This prefix works very much the same way “the time
that”, “the one who”, “the place where”, “the thing that”, and so forth
are used in English when they are *not* being used to ask a question.

Note:

  - The prefix Ꮵ- is never used with the prefix Ᏹ-, they go in the same
    place.

  - If the prefix Ꮵ- is used before a “w” sound it becomes “Ꮷ-” (jụ-).

  - If using Ꮵ- to refer to a previously mentioned event it must be one
    that was *directly* experienced.

Examples:

  - ᏣᏂ ᎤᏬᏂᏒ. “John spoke.”
    
      - ᏣᏂ ᏒᎯ ᏧᏬᏂᏒ. “John spoke yesterday.” - (Ꮵ + ᎤᏬᏂᏒᎢ) - *Here the
        speaker is referring to a specific point in time that the
        speaker experienced.*
    
      - ᏣᏂ ᏥᎦᏬᏂᎭ. “John just spoke.” - (Ꮵ + Ꭶ + ᎯᏬᏂᎯ + Ꭰ²)
    
      - ᎠᏍᎦᏯ ᏭᏪᏅᏎ. ᏣᏂ ᏧᏬᏂᏎ. “The man went away. The one that John spoke
        with.” (Ꮵ + ᎤᏬᏂᏒᎢ) - *Here the prefix Ꮵ- in the second sentence
        is used to refer to the man who went away in the first
        sentence.*
    
      - ᏣᏂ ᎠᏍᎦᏯ ᎤᏬᏂᏎ. ᎠᏍᎦᏯ ᏧᏭᏪᏅᏎ “John spoke with the man. That man is
        the one who went away.” (Ꮵ + Ꮻ = ᎤᏪᏅᏒᎢ) - *Here the prefix Ꮵ- in
        the second sentence is used to clarify that the man who went
        away is the same as the one John spoke with in the first
        sentence.*

  - ᏣᏬᏂᏒ. “You spoke.”
    
      - ᏒᎯ ᏥᏣᏬᏂᏒ. “You spoke yesterday.” - (Ꮵ + Ꮳ + ᎤᏬᏂᏒᎢ)
    
      - ᏥᎯᏬᏂᎭ. “You just spoke.” - (Ꮵ + ᎯᏬᏂᎯ + Ꭰ²)

  - ᏩᎭᏯ ᏥᎪᎲ. “I saw a wolf.”
    
      - ᏒᎯ ᏩᎭᏯ ᏥᏥᎪᎲ. “Yesterday I saw a wolf.” - (Ꮵ + Ꮵ + ᎤᎪᎲᎢ)
    
      - ᏩᎭᏯ ᏥᏥᎪᏩᏔ. “I saw a wolf just now.” - (Ꮵ + Ꮵ + ᎯᎪᏩᏔ + Ꭰ²)

  - ᎦᏙ ᏣᏛᏁᎴ ᏒᎯ? “What did you do yesterday?” - *The prefix Ꮵ- is not
    used here even though the speaker is referring to a specific point
    in time, as the question is about an event the speaker did not
    directly experience.*
    
      - ᏣᎩᏬᏂᏒ. “I spoke.” - (Ꮵ + ᎠᎩ + ᎤᏬᏂᏒᎢ) - *Here the speaker is
        referring to a specific point in time and directly experienced
        the event so that the use of the prefix Ꮵ- is expected.*

  - ᎦᏙ ᏣᏛᏁᎴ? “What did you do?”
    
      - ᎠᎩᏬᏂᏒ. “I spoke.” - (ᎠᎩ + ᎤᏬᏂᏒᎢ) - *Because there was no
        reference to a specific point in time, it is not appropriate to
        use the prefix Ꮵ- here.*

  - ᎬᏂᎨ ᏩᎭᏯ ᎠᎴ ᎤᏁᎦ ᏩᎭᏯ ᎤᎿ ᎨᏎ. ᏌᏊ ᏌᎶᎵ ᏧᎨ. ᎤᏁᎦ ᏥᎨᏎ. “A black wolf and a
    white wolf were there. One of them ate a squirrel. It was the white
    one.” - *In this example the prefix Ꮵ- is used twice. It’s first use
    (ᏧᎨ from Ꮵ + ᎤᎬᎢ) refers back to the previously mentioned wolves and
    is translated as “of them” into English. It’s second use (ᏥᎨᏎ from Ꮵ
    + ᎨᏒᎢ) refers specifically to previously mentioned white wolf and is
    translated as “one”.*
