If you take the Infinitive form and add a high falling tone on its
rightmost long vowel you imply a “need to do” something. *Knowing
exactly where to add this tone requires experience listening to long
timer speakers of the language.* ☞ You can indicate that it is a “must
do” instead of a “need do” by adding the word ᎠᏎ “a²se”.

        change in tones.*

written. Context is required to determine correct meaning.*
