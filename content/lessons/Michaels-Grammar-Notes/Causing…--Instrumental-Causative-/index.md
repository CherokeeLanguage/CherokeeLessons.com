To indicate that something is being caused to happen add one of the
following special endings to the matching tense stem.
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">There is a special pronunciation
change based on the final sound of the stem you are attaching
to\!</span>

This suffix only attaches to verbs that do not indicate something or
someone doing for themselves. This suffix can not be used on verbs such
as “He is running”. In such cases a verb that indicates some degree of
“to make it”, “to cause it”, or “to motivate it” should be used
instead.

*Note: The present tense suffix attaches to the present tense stem, the
past tense suffix attaches to the past tense stem, and so forth.*

### S-Form

Use one of the following suffixes if the stem ends with a “a”, “e”, “i”,
“o”, “u”, “v”, “w”, “y”, “n”, or “l” sound. *These are the soft
“sonorant” sounds.*

  - \-ᏍᏗᎭ  
    \[-sdi²ha\] “is causing it to …”

  - \-ᏍᏓᏅᎢ  
    \[-sdạ²nv²³ɂi\] “did cause it to …”

  - \-ᏍᏗᏍᎪᎢ  
    \[-sdi²sgo³ɂi\] “habitually causes it to be …”

  - \-ᏍᏓ  
    \[-sda\] “let cause it to …”

  - \-ᏍᏙᏗ  
    \[-sdọ²di\] “to cause it to …”

### H-Form

If the stem ends with a “d/t”, “g/k”, “tl”, “j/ch”, or “s” sound then
use one of the following suffixes. *These are the harder “obstruent”
sounds.*

  - \-ᏗᎭ  
    \[-hdi²ha\] “is causing it to …”

  - \-ᏓᏅᎢ  
    \[-hdạ²nv²³ɂi\] “did cause it to …”

  - \-ᏗᏍᎪᎢ  
    \[-hdi²sgo³ɂi\] “habitually causes it to be …”

  - \-Ꮣ  
    \[-hda\] “let cause it to …”

  - \-ᏙᏗ  
    \[-hdọ²di\] “to cause it to …”

*When this set is used, an ending “d” becomes “t”, an ending “g” becomes
“k”, , and an ending “j” becomes “ch”.*
