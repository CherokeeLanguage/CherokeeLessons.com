  - Ꮒ- + Ꮥ- becomes ᏂᏗ-

☞ The Ꮒ- prefix can indicate “next to the *speaker’s point of reference*
in a *lateral* position”.

In the “Cherokee-English Dictionary”, this point of reference is called
“the speaker’s position”.

In the “A Reference Grammar of Oklahoma Cherokee”, this point of
reference is called “the deictic center”.

In many cases the prefix “nị-” is used to indicate “beside” or “next
to”.

*Assume the point of reference is in relation to the speaker unless
context indicates otherwise.*
