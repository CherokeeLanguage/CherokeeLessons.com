If you take the *Present Habitual* form and replace the ending “-o³ɂi”
with “-v³ɂi” or “-e³ɂi” you create the *Past Progressive* form. This
form indicates an action that was ongoing at a certain point in the
past.

☞ *Note how this matches “ᎨᏐᎢ (gesoi) - often is being”, “ᎨᏒᎢ (gesvi) -
was being”, and “ᎨᏎᎢ (gesei) - was reportedly being”.*

⚠ *Note that “was/were… ing” is used in all of these examples. This is
the correct form to use when you are wanting to express something in
Cherokee that occurred in the past where English would use “was/were…
ing”.*
