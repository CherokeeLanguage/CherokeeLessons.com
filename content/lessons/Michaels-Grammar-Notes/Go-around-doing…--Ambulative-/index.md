If you want to refer to the act of doing something as a generic concept,
like how “speech” is the result of “speaking” and “talk” is the result
of “talking”, you take the bound pronoun prefix from the present tense
“is doing” form and combine that with the infinitive “to be” form. Use
“dị-” on these new words to form plurals. Examples:

  - ᎠᏓᎾᏁᏒᎲᏍᎦ  
    \[adananesvhvsga\] “He/she is shopping.” *The present tense form.*
    
      - ᎤᏓᎾᏁᏒᎲᏍᏗ  
        \[udananesvhvsdi\] “He/she to shop.” *The infinitive “to be”
        form.*
    
      - ᎠᏓᎾᏁᏒᎲᏍᏗ  
        \[adananesvhvsdi\] “A shopping trip.” *The newly created “result
        of” form.*
        
          - ᏗᏓᎾᏁᏒᎲᏍᏗ  
            \[didananesvhvsdi\] “Shopping trips.” *di- +
            -adananesvhvsdi.*

  - ᎠᎪᏩᏘᎭ  
    \[agowhtiha\] “He/she sees him/her/it.” *The present tense form.*
    
      - ᎤᎪᏩᏛᏗ  
        \[ugowhtvhdi\] “Him to see him/her/it.” *The infinitive “to be”
        form.*
    
      - ᎠᎪᏩᏛᏗ  
        \[agowhtvhdi\] “Sight.” *The newly created “result of” form.*
        
          - ᏗᎪᏩᏛᏗ  
            \[digowhtvhdi\] “Sights.” *di- + -agowhtvhdi.*

  - ᎦᏬᏂᎭ  
    \[gawoniha\] “He/she is speaking.” *The present tense form.*
    
      - ᎤᏬᏂᎯᏍᏗ  
        \[uwonihisdi\] “Him to speak.” *The infinitive “to be” form.*
    
      - ᎦᏬᏂᎯᏍᏗ  
        \[gawonihisdi\] “Speech. Language.” *The newly created “result
        of” form.*
        
          - ᏗᎦᏬᏂᎯᏍᏗ  
            \[digawonihisdi\] “Speeches. Languages.” *di- +
            -gawonihisdi.*

  - ᎤᏚᎵᎭ  
    \[uduliha\] “He/she wants him/her/it.” *The present tense form.*
    
      - ᎤᏚᎸᏗ  
        \[uduhldi\] “Him to want him/her/it.” *The infinitive “to be”
        form.*
    
      - ᎤᏚᎸᏗ  
        \[uduhldi\] “A wanting. A need. A desire.” *The newly created
        “result of” form.*
        
          - ᏧᏚᎸᏗ  
            \[juduhldi\] “Wantings. Needs. Desires.” *di- + -uduhldi.*

*On many of these result forms, many speakers will add a high tone on
the right most long vowel to indicate this is a created word. Adding
this pitch is not required to be understood correctly in most cases and
when to do so is best learned by listening to long time speakers.*

As in English, there are some forms which will not make sense when
creating new words.
