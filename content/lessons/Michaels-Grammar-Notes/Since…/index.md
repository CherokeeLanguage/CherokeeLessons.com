Ꭶ- is used to indicate a period of time has occurred (or will have
occurred) since the start of an event.

This prefix goes just before the bound pronoun, after Ꮥ/Ꮧ.

Add the prefix Ꭶ-, being careful about the pronunciation rules.
<!-- more -->
Can be added to past tense, etc.

Ꭶ- before consonents. ᎦᏱ͓- before vowels; Ꭶ- + -Ꭰ =\> Ꭼ; Ꭶ- becomes Ꭸ-
for 2nd person forms, Ꭶ- becomes ᎬᏩ͓- for third person forms, ᎬᏩ͓ + Ꭴ
=\> ᎬᏩ.
