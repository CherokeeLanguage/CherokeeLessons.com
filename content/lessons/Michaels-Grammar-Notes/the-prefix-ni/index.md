The special prefix “nị-” is used quite often in Cherokee for various
meanings.

#### Pronunciation

The Basic pronunciation rules for “nị-” are as follows:
<!-- more -->
  - It is added before the bound pronoun.
    
      - If any plural markers “de-”, “di-”, “ge-”, or “ga-” are used,
        add it before them.
        
          - “de-” becomes “dị-” after “nị-” unless followed by a high
            tone. (Ꮒ- + Ꮥ- becomes ᏂᏗ-)

  - If “nị-” is followed by a vowel, the “-ị-” is dropped.

  - If “nị-” is followed by an “-h-” sound, the “-h-” sound combines
    with the “nị-” sound to give “hn-”.

  - If “nị-” is used on the infinitive “to be” form or on any word
    created out of the infinitive, such as the “Result of Doing” form,
    it changes sound and becomes “i-” before a consonant or “iy-” before
    a vowel. ☞ *Some speakers will remove the leading “i-” off of “iy-”
    , even in formal speech.*
