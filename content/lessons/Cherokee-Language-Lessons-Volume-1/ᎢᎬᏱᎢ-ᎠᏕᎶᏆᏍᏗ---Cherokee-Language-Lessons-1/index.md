## Dialects

Cherokee is grouped into three major dialects:

  - ᎡᎳᏘ (Elati).  
    This dialect was historically spoken by inhabitants of the Lower
    Towns in the vicinity of the South Carolina–Georgia border before
    the forced removal of 1838 and uses an “r” sound where the other two
    dialects use an “l” sound. This is also known as “The Lower”
    dialect. This dialect is believed to have become extinct around 1900.

  - ᎣᏔᎵ (Otali).  
    This dialect is spoken in Oklahoma and by the Snowbird Community in
    North Carolina and is known as the “Western” or “Overhill” dialect.

  - ᎩᏚᏩ (Kituhwa).  
    Commonly referred to as the “Eastern” dialect, it is spoken by the
    Eastern band on the Qualla Boundary in North Carolina, and is known
    as “The Middle” dialect.

There is no single central form of Cherokee, instead, there are many
variations of pronunciation and word usage within each dialect, usually
centered around different communities and townships.

The vocabulary and language structure as presented in this lesson
material is based primarily on the “Cherokee-English Dictionary (ᏣᎳᎩ-ᏲᏁᎦ
ᏗᏕᏠᏆᏍᏙᏗ)” published in 1975 by the *Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma*, and is
commonly referred to as the “Durbin Feeling Dictionary” or “CED”.

## The Approach

This lesson material uses many of the concepts from both the *TPR* and
the *TPRS* language learning approaches.

> *TPR* (Total Physical Response) is a language teaching method
> developed by James Asher, a professor emeritus of psychology at San
> José State University. It is based on the coordination of language and
> physical movement. In TPR, instructors give commands to students in
> the target language, and students respond with whole-body actions…
> 
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_physical_response>
> 
> ☞ *The core concept of TPR is physical activity in response to the
> language being learned.*
> 
> *TPRS* (TPR Storytelling) is a method of teaching foreign languages.
> TPRS lessons use a mixture of reading and storytelling to help
> students learn a foreign language…
> 
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPR_Storytelling>
> 
> ☞ *The core concept of TPRS is listening to the language as it is used
> to describe a series of connected events.*

Many activities involve TPR by participants performing physical actions
in response to commands. As the activities are carried out, TPRS is used
to enhance the learning experience by having the participants perform a
very simplified form of storytelling by providing different verbal
responses based on what is happening or has happened.

One thing both approaches agree on is that students should be listening
and only responding with actions only using simple and brief verbal
responses when necessary. It usually takes about 30 hours of instruction
in a classroom setting before students are ready to start speaking
simple sentences. It is important to not force speaking the language
before being ready.

In addition to the TPR and TPRS approaches, there are also sections
explaining core grammar concepts in combination with a few traditional
translation exercises.
