## ᎦᏬᏂᏍᎬᎢ ᎠᎦᏔᎲᎢ (Grammar)

☞ *ᎦᏬᏂᏍᎬᎢ ᎠᎦᏔᎲᎢ - “His ongoing speaking - his ongoing knowing how.”*

### Clitics

☞ *Don’t get hung up on grammar information. Grammar is not something
that needs to be memorized or fully understood. It is through the
exercises in the lesson material that you will learn how to understand
and speak Cherokee, not by memorizing rules and word parts.*

Clitics are special word endings that are used to add or change the
meanings of existing words. They are a very powerful feature of the
Cherokee language and allow you to express a great many complicated
things in short order. It is important to note that these endings cannot
be used alone. They must always be combined with an existing word to
form a new word.
<!-- more -->
  - \-Ꮂ  
    \[-hv\] “But?”

When we add “-hv” to the end of the first word in a sentence, we
indicate we are asking “But for?”.

Examples:

  - ᏌᏊ. ᏌᏊᎲ? “One. But for the one?”

  - ᏂᎯ. ᏂᎯᎲ? “You. But for you?”

<!-- end list -->

  - \-Ꮎ  
    \[-na\] “What of? What about?”

When we add “-na” to the end of the first word in a sentence, we
indicate we are asking “What about? What of?”.

Examples:

  - ᏌᏊ. ᏌᏊᎾ? “One. What of the one?”

  - ᎠᏴ. ᎠᏴᎾ? “Me. What about me?”

<!-- end list -->

  - \-ᏍᎪ, -Ꮝ  
    \[-sgo, -s\] “Yes or No?”

When we add “-ᏍᎪ” to the end of the first word in a sentence, we
indicate we are asking “Is it?”.

Examples:

  - ᎰᏩ. ᎰᏩᏍ? “Okay. Is it Okay?”

  - ᏌᏊ. ᏌᏊᏍ? “One. Is it one?”

  - ᎠᏴ. ᎠᏴᏍᎪ. “Me. Is it me?”

  - ᏂᎯ. ᏂᎯᏍ. “You. Is it you?”

  - ᎥᏝ. ᎥᏝᏍᎪ? “No. Is it no?”

The short form “-Ꮝ” is used more often than the full form “-ᏍᎪ”.

  - \-Ꮚ  
    \[-gwu\] “Just. Only.”

When we add “-Ꮚ” to the end of a word, it is like adding “just” or
“only” before the word in English.

Examples:

  - ᏌᏊ. ᏌᏊᏊ. “One. Just one.”

  - ᎣᏍᏓ. ᎣᏍᏓᏊ. “Good. Only good.”

<!-- end list -->

  - \-Ꮷ  
    \[-ju\] “It is, isn’t it? Right?”

When we add “-Ꮷ” to the end of the first word in a sentence we are
asking “It is, isn’t it?”.

  - ᎰᏩ. ᎰᏩᏧ? “Okay. It’s okay, right?”

  - ᏌᏊ. ᏌᏊᏧ? “One. It is one, right?”

When we combine these special endings with our existing vocabulary, we
greatly expand what we can express. Here are some possible combinations:

1.  Ayv. “I.”
    
    1.  Ayvju? “It is me, right?”
    
    2.  Ayvgwu. “It is just me.”
    
    3.  Ayvna? “What about me?”
    
    4.  Ayvhv? “But for me?”
    
    5.  Ayvnahv? “But what about me?”
    
    6.  Ayvgwuju? “It is just me, right?”

2.  Nihi. “You.”
    
    1.  Nihiju? “It is you, right?”
    
    2.  Nihigwu. “It is just you.”
    
    3.  Nihina? “What about you?”
    
    4.  Nihihv? “But for you?”
    
    5.  Nihinahv? “But what about you?”
    
    6.  Nihigwuju? “It is just you, right?”

3.  Howa. “Okay.”
    
    1.  Howaju? “It is okay, right?”

4.  Osda. “Good.”
    
    1.  Osdaju? “It is good, right?”
    
    2.  Osdagwu. “It is only good.”

5.  Uyoi. “Bad.”
    
    1.  Uyoiju? “It is bad, right?”
    
    2.  Uyoigwu. “It is only bad.”

6.  Jalagi. “Cherokee.”
    
    1.  Jalagiju? “It is Cherokee, right?”
    
    2.  Jalagigwu. “It is only Cherokee.”
    
    3.  Jalagigwuju? “It is only Cherokee, right?”

      - ᎥᏝ, Ꮭ ᏩᏯ ᎠᏂ ᏱᎩ. “No, the wolf isn’t here.”

## ᏂᏔᏛᎦ (Do them)

You will need the following props:

  - Two slips of paper with “ᎤᏲᎢ” on them.

  - Two slips of paper with “ᎣᏍᏓ” on them.

  - A sheet of paper with only Cherokee writing on it.

  - A sheet of paper with only English writing on it.

  - A woman doll.

  - A man doll.

  - A toy dog.

  - A toy cat*.*

  - A toy deer.

  - A toy wolf.

  - A toy rabbit.

  - A toy beaver.

  - A potato.

  - A rock.

  - An acorn.

  - A bean.

☞ *During the exercises you must pretend that the people and animals are
alive.*

☞ *Substitute pictures or drawings as needed.*

Divide up into groups of three to six. If you don’t have enough people,
use props for imaginary people and act the imaginary people out.

### Groups of three or more

Using pillows or other props, add enough imaginary study partners to
create a group of six.

For each group the first person is designated “Ꭰ”. The second person is
designated “Ꭱ”. The remaining people are grouped together and are
designated “Ꭲ”. After each set, rotate positions so that “Ꭰ” becomes the
“Ꭱ”, the “Ꭱ” becomes one of the “Ꭲ”, and one of the “Ꭲ” becomes the “Ꭰ”.

☞ *Keep rotating until everyone has been in position “Ꭱ”, starting over
with the first set of challenges as needed.*

☞ *Any imaginary study partners always stay as one of the “Ꭲ” and do not
rotate.*

☞ *The “Ꭰ” responses should be read from the book. The “Ꭱ” responses
should be done without reading the book.*

Each challenge-response comes in one of five main forms and should be
done as in the following examples:

1.  \[Ꭰ\] ᎤᏲᎢ ᏙᏯ. ᎣᏍᏓ ᎠᏍᎦᏯ.  
    “Ꭰ” places a beaver with “ᎤᏲᎢ” and a man with “ᎣᏍᏓ” before “Ꭱ”.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᎠᏍᎦᏯ ᎣᏍᏓ.  
        “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: The man is good.
    
    2.  \[Ꭱ→Ꭰ\] ᏙᏯᎾ?  
        “Ꭱ” asks about the other one: What about the beaver?
    
    3.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᏙᏯ ᎤᏲᎢ.  
        “Ꭰ” responds to “Ꭱ”: The beaver is bad.

2.  \[Ꭰ\] ᎣᏍᏓ ᎠᎭᏫ. ᎤᏲᎢ ᏩᏯ.  
    “Ꭰ” places a deer with “ᎣᏍᏓ” and a wolf with “ᎤᏲᎢ” before “Ꭱ”.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᎠᎭᏫᏍᎪ ᎤᏲᎢ?  
        “Ꭰ” asks “Ꭱ”: Is the deer bad?
    
    2.  \[Ꭱ→Ꭰ\] ᎥᏝ, Ꮭ ᎠᎭᏫ ᎤᏲᎢ ᏱᎩ.  
        “Ꭱ” looks at the deer and responds: No, it isn’t a bad deer.

3.  \[Ꭰ\] ᎤᏲᎢ ᎠᏫ. ᎣᏍᏓ ᎠᏍᎦᏯ.  
    “Ꭰ” places a deer with “ᎤᏲᎢ” and a man with “ᎣᏍᏓ” before “Ꭱ”.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᎥᎥ, ᎠᏫᏧ ᎤᏲᎢ?  
        “Ꭰ” asks “Ꭱ”: Yes, the deer is bad, right?
    
    2.  \[Ꭱ→Ꭰ\] ᎥᎥ, ᎠᏫ ᎤᏲᎢ.  
        “Ꭱ” looks at the deer and responds: Yes, the deer is bad.

4.  \[Ꭰ\] ᎤᏲᎢ ᎠᎭᏫ. ᎤᏲᎢ ᏩᏯ.  
    “Ꭰ” places a deer with “ᎤᏲᎢ” and a wolf with “ᎤᏲᎢ” before “Ꭱ”.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᎠᎭᏫᏊᏍᎪ ᎤᏲᎢ?  
        “Ꭰ” asks “Ꭱ”: Is just the deer bad?
    
    2.  \[Ꭱ→Ꭰ\] ᎥᏝ, ᎠᎭᏫ ᎤᏲᎢ ᎠᎴ ᏩᏯ ᎤᏲᎢ.  
        “Ꭱ” looks at the deer and wolf and responds: No, the deer is bad
        and the wolf is bad.

5.  \[Ꭰ\] ᎤᏲᎢ ᏥᏍᏚ. ᎤᏲᎢ ᏪᏌ.  
    “Ꭰ” places a rabbit with “ᎤᏲᎢ” and a cat with “ᎤᏲᎢ” before “Ꭱ”.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᎥᎥ, ᏥᏍᏚᏊᏧ ᎤᏲᎢ?  
        “Ꭰ” asks “Ꭱ”: Yes, just the rabbit is bad, right?
    
    2.  \[Ꭱ→Ꭰ\] ᎥᏝ, ᏥᏍᏚ ᎤᏲᎢ ᎠᎴ ᏪᏌ ᎤᏲᎢ.  
        “Ꭱ” looks at the rabbit and cat and responds: No, the rabbit is
        bad and the cat is bad.

### Someone Alone

Using pillows or other props, add enough imaginary study partners to
create a group of six.

On index cards, slips of paper, or something similar, write out the “Ꭰ”
challenges on each of the front sides along with the correct “Ꭱ”
responses on the reverse side for the first set of challenges. Do this
for each challenge as listed. There may be challenges and responses
repeated. Keep the cards in order.

☞ *The “Ꭰ” responses should be read from the cards. The “Ꭱ” responses
should be done without reading the cards.*

#### For “Set 1”:

Place the stack of index cards, challenge side up, response side down.

For each challenge that uses props place the appropriate items in easy
reach and just outside of easy reach.

Have an imaginary study partner “Ꭰ”. Start out as the “Ꭱ” person. After
each set switch places with your imaginary study partner. You must act
out both sides.

Flip the card over and check your response against the response on the
response side of the index card.

#### For each remaining set:

Adjust the index cards to match the new set, creating new ones as
needed, and removing those not in the set. Follow the instructions
previously given for “Set 1”.

### Sets

☞ *Repeat these until everyone can do the “Ꭱ” responses smoothly without
having to reference the material.*
