## ᎦᏬᏂᏍᎬᎢ ᎠᎦᏔᎲᎢ (Grammar)

☞ *Remember that it is through the exercises in the lesson material that
you will learn how to understand and speak Cherokee, not by memorizing
rules and word parts.*

The Cherokee words for “is”, “was”, and “will be” work a little
differently than they do in English. The words have special forms to
indicate just now, now and on going, usually, a while ago, first hand
knowledge, and second hand knowledge.

The special first hand and second hand knowledge forms will be indicated
by references to “*with personal knowledge*” and “*without personal
knowledge*”. “*With personal knowledge*” indicates being a first hand
witness. “*Without personal knowledge”* indicates being told something
by someone else making your information second hand.

☞ *In some materials you will see these words grouped together as one
and referred to as “the copula”.*

## ᏘᎪᎵᏯ (Read them)

  - ᎢᎩ  
    \[i⁴gi\] “Is.” ☞ *Is now or was just now.*

  - ᎢᎦ  
    \[i⁴ga\] “Is.” ☞ *Now and ongoing.*

  - ᎨᏐᎢ  
    \[ge¹so³ɂi\] “Is.” ☞ *Usually, habitually, or on certain occasions.*

  - ᎨᏒᎢ  
    \[ge¹sv²³ɂi\] “Being.”

  - ᎨᏒᎩ  
    \[ge¹sv²³gi\] “Was being.” ☞ *With personal knowledge, or
    consciousness.*

  - ᎨᏎᎢ  
    \[ge¹se³ɂi\] “Was being.” ☞ *Without personal knowledge, or
    consciousness.*

  - ᎨᎲᎢ  
    \[ge¹hv²³ɂi\] “Been (a while ago).”

  - ᎨᎲᎩ  
    \[ge¹hv²³gi\] “Was (a while ago).” ☞ *With personal knowledge, or
    consciousness.*

  - ᎨᎮᎢ  
    \[ge¹he³ɂi\] “Was (a while ago).” ☞ *Without personal knowledge, or
    consciousness.*

  - ᎨᏎᏍᏗ  
    \[ge¹se³sdi\] “Will be being.”

When looking at the previous vocabulary, it should be easy to see a
pattern that indicates some common endings are in use.

“*Being*” is indicated by the -ᎥᎢ (-v²³i) ending. In English we indicate
this by phrases such as “His act of …”, “His being …”, “His …ness”.

“*With personal knowledge*” is indicated by the -ᎥᎩ (-v²³gi) ending. In
English we indicate this by phrases such as “I know for a fact that …”.

“*Without personal knowledge”* is indicated by the -ᎡᎢ (-e²³ɂi) ending.
In English we indicate this by phrases such as “Reportedly …”,
“Supposedly …”.

“*Usually*” is indicated by the -ᎣᎢ (-o³ɂi) ending. In English we
indicate this by phrases such as “Usually …”, “Often …”.

“*Will be*” is indicated by the -ᎡᏍᏗ (-e³sdi) ending.

☞ *In the preceding vocabulary you saw words ending in both -ᎥᎩ (with
personal knowledge) and -ᎥᎢ (being). Some dialects of Cherokee do not
use the -ᎥᎩ ending and instead use -ᎥᎢ for both “being” and “was with
personal knowledge”. Such dialects use context to keep the two different
meanings separate. As many historical documents use the -ᎥᎩ ending
extensively and its use appears in some modern publications such as “The
Cherokee Phoenix”, this material will be teaching the use of both -ᎥᎩ
and -ᎥᎢ.*

The various words for “is” can be combined with Ꮭ and Ᏹ- to create the
standard not forms:

  - Ꮭ ᏱᎩ  
    \[hla yi⁴gi\] “Isn’t.”

  - Ꮭ ᏱᎦ  
    \[hla yi⁴ga\] “Isn’t.”

  - Ꮭ ᏱᎨᏐᎢ  
    \[hla yi²ge¹so³ɂi\] “Isn’t usually.”

  - Ꮭ ᏱᎨᏒᎢ  
    \[hla yi²ge¹sv²³ɂi\] “Not being.”

  - Ꮭ ᏱᎨᏎᎢ  
    \[hla yi²ge¹se³ɂi\] “Wasn’t being.” ☞ *Without personal knowledge,
    or consciousness.*

  - Ꮭ ᏱᎨᎲᎢ  
    \[hla yi²ge¹hv²³ɂi\] “Had not been (a while ago).”

  - Ꮭ ᏱᎨᎮᎢ  
    \[hla yi²ge¹he³ɂi\] “Wasn’t (a while ago).” ☞ *Without personal
    knowledge, or consciousness.*

  - Ꮭ ᏱᎨᏎᏍᏗ  
    \[hla yi²ge¹se³sdi\] “Will not be being.”

☞ *When using the Ᏹ- prefix you should use the -ᎡᎢ “without personal
knowledge” ending instead of the -ᎥᎩ “with personal knowledge” ending.
This also applies when asking questions.*

Divide up into groups of four to seven. If necessary, add enough pretend
study partners to make your group a size of four.

### Groups

For each group the first person is designated “Ꭰ”. The second person is
designated “Ꭱ”. The third person is designated “Ꭲ”. Any remaining people
are grouped together and are designated “Ꭳ”. After each set, rotate
positions so that “Ꭰ” becomes the “Ꭱ”, the “Ꭱ” becomes the “Ꭲ”, the “Ꭲ”
becomes one of the “Ꭳ” and one of the “Ꭳ” becomes the “Ꭰ”.

☞ *Keep rotating until everyone has been in position “Ꭰ”, starting over
with the first set of challenges as needed.*

☞ *The “Ꭰ” responses should be read from the book. The “Ꭱ” and “Ꭲ”
responses should be done without reading the book. The “Ꭰ” person should
help as needed.*

Each challenge-response should be done as in the following examples:

1.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᏂᎯᏊ.  
    “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: Just you.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᏌᎪᏂᎨ ᏅᏯ ᎨᏎᏍᏗ.  
        “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: It will be a blue rock.
    
    2.  \[Ꭰ\] cards → \[Ꭱ\].  
        “Ꭰ” passes to “Ꭱ” a single blue color card and a single rock
        card.
    
    3.  \[Ꭱ→Ꭲ\] ᏌᎪᏂᎨ ᏅᏯ.  
        Only “Ꭱ” looks at the cards.  
        “Ꭱ” says to “Ꭲ”: It’s a blue rock.
    
    4.  \[Ꭲ→Ꭳ\] ᏌᎪᏂᎨ ᏅᏯ.  
        “Ꭲ” says to “Ꭳ”: It’s a blue rock.
    
    5.  \[Ꭰ\] ← cards \[Ꭱ\].  
        “Ꭰ” retrieves the cards from “Ꭱ”.
    
    6.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᎰᏩ.  
        “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: Alright.

        “Ꭱ” says to “Ꭲ”: It was a blue rock.

        “Ꭲ” says to “Ꭳ”: Reportedly it was a blue rock.

    “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: Just you.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᎤᏁᎦ ᎫᎴ ᎨᏎᏍᏗ.  
        “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: It will be a white acorn.
    
    2.  \[Ꭰ\] cards → \[Ꭱ\].  
        “Ꭰ” passes to “Ꭱ” a single white color card and a single acorn
        card.
    
    3.  \[Ꭱ→Ꭲ\] ᎤᏁᎦ ᎫᎴ.  
        Only “Ꭱ” looks at the cards.  
        “Ꭱ” says to “Ꭲ”: It’s a white acorn.
    
    4.  \[Ꭲ→Ꭳ\] ᎤᏁᎦ ᎫᎴ.  
        “Ꭲ” says to “Ꭳ”: It’s a white acorn.
    
    5.  \[Ꭰ\] ← cards \[Ꭱ\].  
        “Ꭰ” retrieves the cards from “Ꭱ”.
    
    6.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] Ꮠ ᎢᎦ.  
        “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: Another day. (To indicate a day’s passing.)
    
    7.  \[Ꭱ→Ꭲ\] ᎤᏁᎦ ᎫᎴ ᎨᎲᎩ.  
        “Ꭱ” says to “Ꭲ”: It was a white acorn a while ago.
    
    8.  \[Ꭲ→Ꭳ\] ᎤᏁᎦ ᎫᎴ ᎨᎮᎢ.  
        “Ꭲ” says to “Ꭳ”: Reportedly it was a white acorn a while ago.

3.  ᏩᎭᏯ, ᏐᏈᎵ, ᏅᏯ, ᏄᎾ.

    in a row.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᏅᏯ ᏱᎨᏐ Ꮭ ᏄᎾ ᏱᎨᏐᎢ.  
        “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: If there is a rock, there isn’t a potato.
    
    2.  ✗ ᏄᎾ.  
        “Ꭱ” turns the potato card over to indicate it doesn’t belong.

4.  ᎤᏁᎦ ᎩᏟ.  
    “Ꭰ” picks up a single white color card and a single dog card up and
    shows them to “Ꭱ”.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᎯᎠᏍ ᎠᏓᎭᎵᎨ ᏌᎶᎵ?  
        “Ꭰ” ask “Ꭱ”: Is this a purple squirrel?

    3.  \[Ꭰ\] Cards ↓.  
        “Ꭰ” lays the cards picture down.
    
    4.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᎰᏩ, ᎥᏍᎩᎾᏍ ᎠᏓᎭᎵᎨ ᏩᎭᏯ ᎨᏎᎢ?  
        “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: Alright, was it a purple wolf?
    
    5.  \[Ꭱ→Ꭰ\] ᎥᎥ, ᎥᏍᎩᎾ ᎠᏓᎭᎵᎨ ᏩᎭᏯ ᎨᏒᎩ.  
        “Ꭱ” says to “Ꭰ”: Yes, it was a purple wolf.

6.  ᏪᏌ, ᏐᏈᎵ, ᏌᏛᏗ, ᏚᏯ.

        “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: If there is a trap, there is a bean.
    
    2.  ✓ ᏌᏛᏗ, ✓ ᏚᏯ.  
        “Ꭱ” places the trap and bean cards together.  
        “Ꭱ” turns the other cards picture down to indicate they don’t
        belong.

7.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᎦᏙ ᏧᎾᏍᏗ ᏓᏂᎪᏩᏘᎭ?  
    “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: What are they seeing?
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ→Ꭱ\] ᎤᏂᏁᎦ ᎠᏂᏴᏫ ᎠᏂᎬᎿᎨ ᏪᏌ ᏓᏂᎪᏩᏘᎭ.  
        “Ꭰ” says to “Ꭱ”: The white people see black cats.  
        “Ꭱ” selects and places the plural white card with the people
        card.  
        “Ꭱ” selects and places the plural black card with the plural
        cats card.  
        “Ꭱ” positions the cards to indicate that the white people are
        seeing the black cats.  
        (Turn the cards over to be sure both the correct color and
        object cards were picked.)

8.  ᏓᎭᎵᎨ ᏅᏯ.

### Someone Alone

Add three pretend study partners and follow the instructions for Groups.

☞ *Use an index card and hide the “Ꭱ” and “Ꭲ” responses when reading the
“Ꭰ” challenges. Until you know the exercises steps, you will have to
periodcally check the “Ꭱ” and “Ꭲ” responses before doing them while they
are covered.*

☞ *Remember to speak and act the responses out\!*
