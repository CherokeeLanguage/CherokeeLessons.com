☞ *Remember that if you are having problems recognizing any of the
Syllabary you should do the final Syllabary exercise as a refresher.*

## ᏘᎪᎵᏯ (Read them)

Review the following vocabulary then do the exercises.

☞ *Reminder: Animacy refers to whether a thing is alive or not. Most
alive things are considered animate. Most non-living things are
considered inanimate.*
<!-- more -->
  - ᎦᏙ ᎤᏍᏗ  
    \[gạ²do² u⁴sdi\] “Which one?”

  - ᎯᎳ ᎢᎦ  
    \[hị²la⁴ i²³ga⁴\] “How many?” ☞ *“ᎯᎳ ᎢᎦ” is used when talking about
    inanimate things.*

  - ᎯᎳ ᎢᏯᏂ  
    \[hị²la⁴ ị²yạ³ni\] “How many?” ☞ *“ᎯᎳ ᎢᏯᏂ” is used when talking
    about animate things.*

### ᏗᏎᏍᏗ (Numbers)

  - ᏌᏊ  
    \[sa¹gwu⁴\] “One.”

  - ᏔᎵ  
    \[tạɂ³li\] “Two.”

  - ᎠᏂᏔᎵ  
    \[a²nị²tạɂ³li\] “Two.” ☞ *This is a special form of ᏔᎵ used when
    referring to anything animate.*

  - ᏦᎢ  
    \[jọ²ɂi\] “Three.”

  - ᎠᏂᏦᎢ  
    \[a²nị²jọ²ɂi\] “Three.” ☞ *This is a special form of ᏦᎢ used when
    referring to anything animate.*

  - ᏅᎩ  
    \[nvh²gi\] “Four.”

  - ᎯᏍᎩ  
    \[hị²sgi\] “Five.”

  - ᏑᏓᎵ  
    \[su²³dạ³li\] “Six.”

  - ᎦᎵᏉᎩ  
    \[gahl²gwo²³gi\] “Seven.”

With the exception of the special word “ᎢᎬᏱᎢ (first)”, all of the
ordering numbers are the same as the counting numbers with either “-ᎢᏁᎢ”
or “-ᏏᏁᎢ” added onto the end. This is very similar to the way English
adds “-th” to the end of most ordering numbers like “fourth”, “fifth”,
and “sixth”.

Generally:

  - The ordering numbers are created by dropping the ending vowel then
    adding “-ᎢᏁᎢ”.

  - Ordering numbers higher than one that end with “ᏌᏊ” use “ᏌᏊᎯᏁᎢ” and
    not “ᎢᎬᏱᎢ”. This is because “ᎢᎬᏱᎢ” has a closer literal meaning of
    “earlier than, place of” and is only used where referring to the
    true first position.

  - For the the ordering numbers “ᏌᏚᏏᏁᎢ (eleventh)” through “ᏐᏁᎳᏚᏏᏁᎢ
    (nineteenth)” you don’t drop the ending vowel and instead add
    “-ᏏᏁᎢ”.

<!-- end list -->

  - ᎢᎬᏱᎢ  
    \[ị²gv²yi⁴ɂi\] “First.”

  - ᏔᎵᏁᎢ  
    \[tạɂ²li²ne⁴ɂi\] “Second.”

  - ᏦᎢᏁᎢ  
    \[jọ²ɂi²ne⁴ɂi\] “Third.”

  - ᏅᎩᏁᎢ  
    \[nvh²gi²ne⁴ɂi\] “Fourth.”

  - ᎯᏍᎩᏁᎢ  
    \[hị²sgi²ne⁴ɂi\] “Fifth.”

  - ᏑᏓᎵᏁᎢ  
    \[su²³dạ³li²ne⁴ɂi\] “Sixth.”

  - ᎦᎵᏉᎩᏁᎢ  
    \[gahl²gwo²³gi²ne⁴ɂi\] “Seventh.”

## ᏂᏔᏛᎦ (Do them)

The following exercises are designed to allow you to count and put
things into order in Cherokee. Simply learning the Cherokee names for
the English words for numbers only allows you to translate from English
to Cherokee and vice-versa when dealing with numbers. It does not allow
you to think in Cherokee while dealing with quantities and ordered
positions.

You will need the following props:

  - Two sets of items that are countable.
    
      - The first set should be smooth stones, checkers, or dried beans.
    
      - The second should be toy stuffed animals or pictures of live
        animals.

☞ *During the exercises you must pretend that these are living animals.*

Divide up into groups of three to five. If you don’t have enough people,
use props for imaginary people and act the imaginary people out.

### Groups of Three to Five

For each group the first person is designated “Ꭰ”. The second person is
designated “Ꭱ”. The remaining people are grouped together and are
designated “Ꭲ”. After each set, rotate positions so that “Ꭰ” becomes the
“Ꭱ”, the “Ꭱ” becomes one of the “Ꭲ”, and one of the “Ꭲ” becomes the “Ꭰ”.

☞ *Keep rotating until everyone has been in position “Ꭰ”, starting over
with the first set of challenges as needed.*

☞ *Any imaginary study partners always stay as one of the “Ꭲ” and do not
rotate.*

### Someone Alone

On index cards, slips of paper, or something similar, write out the
challenges on each of the front sides along with the correct response on
the reverse side for the first set of challenges. Do this for each
challenge as listed. There will be challenges and responses repeated.
Keep the cards in order.

#### For “Set 1”:

Place the stack of index cards, challenge side up, response side down.

For each “ᎯᎳ \_\_\_\_?” challenge count out loud the correct number of
appropriate items then flip the card over checking that you counted
correct and that you selected between animate vs inanimate correctly.

For each “ᎦᏚ ᎤᏍᏗ \_\_\_\_?” challenge line up seven items then indicate
the position of each until you reach the position indicated. Flip the
card over and verify you stopped at the correct position.

#### For each remaining set:

Adjust the index cards to match the new set, creating new ones as
needed, and removing those not in the set. Follow the instructions
previously given for “Set 1”.

### Sets

Each challenge-response is structured in one of the following two ways:

1.  “ᎯᎳ \_\_\_\_\_?”
    
    1.  “Ꭰ” selects an appropriate number of items from the correct
        group and places them before “Ꭱ”.
    
    2.  “Ꭰ” asks “Ꭱ”: “ᎯᎳ \_\_\_\_\_?” while pointing at the items for
        counting.
    
    3.  “Ꭱ” counts out loud the items one by one then repeats the final
        count to “Ꭰ”.

2.  “ᎦᏙ ᎤᏍᏗ \_\_\_\_\_?”
    
    1.  “Ꭰ” selects seven items from either group and places them before
        “Ꭱ” lined up in a row.
    
    2.  “Ꭰ” asks “Ꭱ”: “ᎦᏙ ᎤᏍᏗ \_\_\_\_\_?”.
    
    3.  “Ꭱ” says out loud the position of each item from “ᎢᎬᏱᎢ” to
        \_\_\_\_. Then “Ꭱ” points to the correct item and says to “Ꭰ”
        \_\_\_\_\_.
