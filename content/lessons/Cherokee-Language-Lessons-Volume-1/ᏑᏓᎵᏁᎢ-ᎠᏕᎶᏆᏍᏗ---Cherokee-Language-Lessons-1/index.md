## ᏂᏔᏛᎦ (Do them)

You will need the following props:

  - Four male dolls or pictures of men – one man per picture.

  - Four toy dogs or pictures of dogs – one dog per picture.

  - Four potatoes or pictures of potatoes – one potato per picture.

  - Four small rocks or pictures of rocks – one rock per picture.

  - Four toy cats or pictures of cats – one cat per picture.

☞ *During the exercises you must pretend that the people and animals are
alive.*

Divide up into groups of three to five. If you don’t have enough people,
use props for imaginary people and act the imaginary people out.

### Groups of Three to Five

For each group the first person is designated “Ꭰ”. The second person is
designated “Ꭱ”. The remaining people are grouped together and are
designated “Ꭲ”. After each set, rotate positions so that “Ꭰ” becomes the
“Ꭱ”, the “Ꭱ” becomes one of the “Ꭲ”, and one of the “Ꭲ” becomes the “Ꭰ”.

☞ *Keep rotating until everyone has been in position “Ꭱ”, starting over
with the first set of challenges as needed.*

☞ *Any imaginary study partners always stay as one of the “Ꭲ” and do not
rotate.*

Each challenge-response should be done as in the following examples:

1.  \[Ꭰ\] ᏌᏊ ᎠᎨᏯ. ᏌᏊ ᏄᎾ.  
    “Ꭰ” puts one woman in a first group and one potato in second group.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ-\>Ꭱ\] ᎦᏙ ᎤᏍᏗ ᎠᎪᏩᏘᎭ?  
        “Ꭰ” points at the first group and asks “Ꭱ”: What does she see?
    
    2.  \[Ꭱ\] ᎠᎨᏯ ᏄᎾ ᎠᎪᏩᏘᎭ.  
        “Ꭱ” responds: The woman sees a potato.

2.  \[Ꭰ\] ᏌᏊ ᎠᎨᏯ. ᏦᎢ ᏅᏯ.  
    “Ꭰ” puts one woman in a first group and three rocks in second group.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ-\>Ꭱ\] ᎦᏙ ᏧᏍᏗ ᏓᎪᏩᏘᎭ?  
        “Ꭰ” points at the first group and asks “Ꭱ”: What does she see?
    
    2.  \[Ꭱ\] ᎠᎨᏯ ᏅᏯ ᏓᎪᏩᏘᎭ.  
        “Ꭱ” responds: The woman sees rocks.

3.  \[Ꭰ\] ᎠᏂᏔᎵ ᎠᏂᎨᏯ. ᏌᏊ ᏄᎾ.  
    “Ꭰ” puts two women in a first group and one potato in second group.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ-\>Ꭱ\] ᎦᏙ ᎤᏍᏗ ᎠᏂᎪᏩᏘᎭ?  
        “Ꭰ” points at the first group and asks “Ꭱ”: What do they see?
    
    2.  \[Ꭱ\] ᎠᏂᎨᏯ ᏄᎾ ᎠᏂᎪᏩᏘᎭ.  
        “Ꭱ” responds: The women see a potato.

4.  \[Ꭰ\] ᎠᏂᏔᎵ ᎠᏂᎨᏯ. ᏌᏊ ᎠᎨᏯ ᎠᎴ ᏌᏊ ᏅᏯ.  
    “Ꭰ” puts two women in a first group. In the second group are put one
    woman and one rock.
    
    1.  \[Ꭰ-\>Ꭱ\] ᎦᏙ ᏧᏍᏗ ᏓᏂᎪᏩᏘᎭ?  
        “Ꭰ” points at the first group and asks “Ꭱ”: What do they see?
    
    2.  \[Ꭱ\] ᎠᏂᎨᏯ ᎠᎨᏯ ᎠᎴ ᏅᏯ ᏓᏂᎪᏩᏘᎭ.  
        “Ꭱ” responds: The women see a woman and a rock.

### Someone Alone

On index cards, slips of paper, or something similar, write out the
challenges and the Cherokee for “What do you see?” on each of the front
sides along with the correct responses on the reverse side for the first
set of challenges. Do this for each challenge as listed. There may be
challenges and responses repeated. Keep the cards in order.

☞ *The “Ꭰ” challenges should be read from the cards. The “Ꭱ” responses
should be done without reading the cards.*

☞ *Take a short break if needed after every two sets.*

#### For “Set 1”:

Place the stack of index cards, challenge side up, response side down.

For each challenge place the appropriate items in two groups.

Ask aloud the Cherokee challenge on the front of the card while pointing
at the first group.

Respond in Cherokee with: \_\_\_\_ sees \_\_\_\_\_.

Flip the card over and check your response against the response on the
response side of the index card.

#### For each remaining set:

Adjust the index cards to match the new set, creating new ones as
needed, and removing those not in the set. Follow the instructions
previously given for “Set 1”.

### Sets

☞ *Repeat these until everyone can do the “Ꭱ” responses smoothly without
having to reference the material.*
