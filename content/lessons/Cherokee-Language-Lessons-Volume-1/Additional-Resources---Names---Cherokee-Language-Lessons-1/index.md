### *Your Name in Cherokee: Tips for Transliteration: Translation - by Knave from Raleigh, North Carolina*

There are many sites and books out there that have overused the
consonant Q as a default replacement for any foreign consonant that
has no direct analogue with the Cherokee syllabary. The references out
there were somewhat misinformed and apparently forgot about the
plethora of already-transliterated names in the Bible which used
several different letter combinations to replicate English sounds,
instead of relying only on the Q.

##### Let’s begin…

*\*Note: Letters within slashes are the IPA symbols. Transliterations
from the Bible will follow the Cherokee letter in parentheses.*

##### Rhotic Vowels

Unstressed -er /**ɚ**/ (as in dinner) = A (sometimes E, depending on
preference)

Stressed -er, -ur /**ɝ**/ (as in turkey) = V

Stressed -ar /**ɑ˞**/ (as in star) = A

Stressed -or /**ɔ˞**/ (as in north) = O

##### Consonants

B, Br = Qu (Bernice = ᏆᏂᏏ “Quanisi”)

Bl = Tl (Publius = ᏆᏟᏯ “Quatliya”)

C /**k**/ (hard) = K / G (Corinth = ᎪᎵᏂᏗᏱ “Golinidiyi”)

C /**s**/ (soft) = S (Cilicia = ᏏᎵᏏᏱ “Silisiyi”)

Ch /**tʃ**/ (as in cheese) = Ts (Rachel = ᎴᏥᎵ “Letsili”)

Cl, Cr = Tl (Claudius = ᏠᏗᏯ “Tlodiya”, Crete = ᏟᏗ “Tlidi”)

F, Ph = Qu / W (Felix = ᏈᎵᏏ “Quilisi”, Nephthali = ᏁᏩᏔᎵ “Newatali”)

J = Ts (Jesus = ᏥᏌ “Tsisa”)

K = K / G

P, Pr = Qu (Priscilla = ᏈᏏᎳ “Quisila”)

Pl = Tl

R = L / W (Rachel = ᎴᏥᎵ “Letsili”)

Sh /**ʃ**/ (as in sheep) = S

T, Th = T / D (Matthew = ᎹᏚ “Madu”)

Tr = Tl (Troas = ᏠᎠᏏ “Tloasi”)

V = W

X = Gi-S (Usually just transliterated with the S syllables, but if the
/ks/ sound needs to be stressed like in Maxwell = ᎺᎩᏍᏪᎵ “Megisweli” /
Max = ᎺᎩᏏ “Megisi”

Z = Ts / S (Zabulon = ᏤᏆᎳᏂ “Tsequalani”, Nazareth = ᎾᏎᎵᏗ “Naselidi”)

Zh /**ʒ**/ = Ts

These analogues are not always 100% correct, but it is the standard in
transliterating from English to Cherokee. Use this as a base guide and
note that vowels will be transliterated more at random and you must
listen to what sound it makes to replicate it properly in the Cherokee
syllabary.

I hope this helps\! Good luck, transliterators\! Feel free to ask me
(Knave) if you have any questions\!
